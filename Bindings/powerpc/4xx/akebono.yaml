  IBM Akebono board device tree
  =============================

  The IBM Akebono board is a development board for the PPC476GTR SoC.

  0) The root node

     Required properties:

     - model : "ibm,akebono".
     - compatible : "ibm,akebono" , "ibm,476gtr".

  1.a) The Secure Digital Host Controller Interface (SDHCI) node

    Represent the Secure Digital Host Controller Interfaces.

    Required properties:

     - compatible : should be "ibm,476gtr-sdhci","generic-sdhci".
     - reg : should contain the SDHCI registers location and length.
     - interrupt-parent : a phandle for the interrupt controller.
     - interrupts : should contain the SDHCI interrupt.

  1.b) The Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) SATA node

    Represents the advanced host controller SATA interface.

    Required properties:

     - compatible : should be "ibm,476gtr-ahci".
     - reg : should contain the AHCI registers location and length.
     - interrupt-parent : a phandle for the interrupt controller.
     - interrupts : should contain the AHCI interrupt.

  1.c) The FPGA node

    The Akebono board stores some board information such as the revision
    number in an FPGA which is represented by this node.

    Required properties:

     - compatible : should be "ibm,akebono-fpga".
     - reg : should contain the FPGA registers location and length.

  1.d) The AVR node

    The Akebono board has an Atmel AVR microprocessor attached to the I2C
    bus as a power controller for the board.

    Required properties:

     - compatible : should be "ibm,akebono-avr".
     - reg : should contain the I2C bus address for the AVR.
