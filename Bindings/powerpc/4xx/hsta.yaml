  The 476gtr SoC contains a high speed serial assist module attached
  between the plb4 and plb6 system buses to provide high speed data
  transfer between memory and system peripherals as well as support for
  PCI message signalled interrupts.

  Currently only the MSI support is used by Linux using the following

  ppc476gtr High Speed Serial Assist (HSTA) node
  ==============================================

  The 476gtr SoC contains a high speed serial assist module attached
  between the plb4 and plb6 system buses to provide high speed data
  transfer between memory and system peripherals as well as support for
  PCI message signalled interrupts.

  Currently only the MSI support is used by Linux using the following
  device tree entries:

  Require properties:
  - compatible		: "ibm,476gtr-hsta-msi", "ibm,hsta-msi"
  - reg			: register mapping for the HSTA MSI space
  - interrupt-parent	: parent controller for mapping interrupts
  - interrupts		: ordered interrupt mapping for each MSI in the register
  			  space. The first interrupt should be associated with a
  			  register offset of 0x00, the second to 0x10, etc.
