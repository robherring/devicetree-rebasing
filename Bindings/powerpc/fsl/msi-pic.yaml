  * Freescale MSI interrupt controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible : compatible list, may contain one or two entries
    The first is "fsl,CHIP-msi", where CHIP is the processor(mpc8610, mpc8572,
    etc.) and the second is "fsl,mpic-msi" or "fsl,ipic-msi" or
    "fsl,mpic-msi-v4.3" depending on the parent type and version. If mpic
    version is 4.3, the number of MSI registers is increased to 16, MSIIR1 is
    provided to access these 16 registers, and compatible "fsl,mpic-msi-v4.3"
    should be used. The first entry is optional; the second entry is
    required.

  - reg : It may contain one or two regions. The first region should contain
    the address and the length of the shared message interrupt register set.
    The second region should contain the address of aliased MSIIR or MSIIR1
    register for platforms that have such an alias, if using MSIIR1, the second
    region must be added because different MSI group has different MSIIR1 offset.

  - interrupts : each one of the interrupts here is one entry per 32 MSIs,
    and routed to the host interrupt controller. the interrupts should
    be set as edge sensitive.  If msi-available-ranges is present, only
    the interrupts that correspond to available ranges shall be present.

  - interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller
    that services interrupts for this device. for 83xx cpu, the interrupts
    are routed to IPIC, and for 85xx/86xx cpu the interrupts are routed
    to MPIC.

  Optional properties:
  - msi-available-ranges: use <start count> style section to define which
    msi interrupt can be used in the 256 msi interrupts. This property is
    optional, without this, all the MSI interrupts can be used.
    Each available range must begin and end on a multiple of 32 (i.e.
    no splitting an individual MSI register or the associated PIC interrupt).
    MPIC v4.3 does not support this property because the 32 interrupts of an
    individual register are not continuous when using MSIIR1.

  - msi-address-64: 64-bit PCI address of the MSIIR register. The MSIIR register
    is used for MSI messaging.  The address of MSIIR in PCI address space is
    the MSI message address.

    This property may be used in virtualized environments where the hypervisor
    has created an alternate mapping for the MSIR block.  See below for an
    explanation.
