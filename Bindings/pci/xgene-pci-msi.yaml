  * AppliedMicro X-Gene v1 PCIe MSI controller

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "apm,xgene1-msi" to identify
  	      X-Gene v1 PCIe MSI controller block.
  - msi-controller: indicates that this is an X-Gene v1 PCIe MSI controller node
  - reg: physical base address (0x79000000) and length (0x900000) for controller
         registers. These registers include the MSI termination address and data
         registers as well as the MSI interrupt status registers.
  - reg-names: not required
  - interrupts: A list of 16 interrupt outputs of the controller, starting from
  	      interrupt number 0x10 to 0x1f.
  - interrupt-names: not required

  Each PCIe node needs to have property msi-parent that points to an MSI
  controller node
