  V3 Semiconductor V360 EPC PCI bridge

  This bridge is found in the ARM Integrator/AP (Application Platform)

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be one of:
    "v3,v360epc-pci"
    "arm,integrator-ap-pci", "v3,v360epc-pci"
  - reg: should contain two register areas:
    first the base address of the V3 host bridge controller, 64KB
    second the configuration area register space, 16MB
  - interrupts: should contain a reference to the V3 error interrupt
    as routed on the system.
  - bus-range: see pci.txt
  - ranges: this follows the standard PCI bindings in the IEEE Std
    1275-1994 (see pci.txt) with the following restriction:
    - The non-prefetchable and prefetchable memory windows must
      each be exactly 256MB (0x10000000) in size.
    - The prefetchable memory window must be immediately adjacent
      to the non-prefetcable memory window
  - dma-ranges: three ranges for the inbound memory region. The ranges must
    be aligned to a 1MB boundary, and may be 1MB, 2MB, 4MB, 8MB, 16MB, 32MB,
    64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, 1GB or 2GB in size. The memory should be marked
    as pre-fetchable. Two ranges are supported by the hardware.

  Integrator-specific required properties:
  - syscon: should contain a link to the syscon device node, since
    on the Integrator, some registers in the syscon are required to
    operate the V3 host bridge.
