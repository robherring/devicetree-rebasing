  * Cadence PCIe host controller

  This PCIe controller inherits the base properties defined in
  host-generic-pci.txt.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain "cdns,cdns-pcie-host" to identify the IP used.
  - reg: Should contain the controller register base address, PCIe configuration
    window base address, and AXI interface region base address respectively.
  - reg-names: Must be "reg", "cfg" and "mem" respectively.
  - #address-cells: Set to <3>
  - #size-cells: Set to <2>
  - device_type: Set to "pci"
  - ranges: Ranges for the PCI memory and I/O regions
  - #interrupt-cells: Set to <1>
  - interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI properties to define the
    mapping of the PCIe interface to interrupt numbers.

  Optional properties:
  - cdns,max-outbound-regions: Set to maximum number of outbound regions
    (default 32)
  - cdns,no-bar-match-nbits: Set into the no BAR match register to configure the
    number of least significant bits kept during inbound (PCIe -> AXI) address
    translations (default 32)
  - vendor-id: The PCI vendor ID (16 bits, default is design dependent)
  - device-id: The PCI device ID (16 bits, default is design dependent)
