  * Samsung Exynos 5440 PCIe interface

  This PCIe host controller is based on the Synopsys DesignWare PCIe IP
  and thus inherits all the common properties defined in designware-pcie.txt.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "samsung,exynos5440-pcie"
  - reg: base addresses and lengths of the PCIe controller,
  - reg-names : First name should be set to "elbi".
  	And use the "config" instead of getting the configuration address space
  	from "ranges".
  	NOTE: When using the "config" property, reg-names must be set.
  - interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs for level interrupt,
  	pulse interrupt, special interrupt.
  - phys: From PHY binding. Phandle for the generic PHY.
  	Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/samsung-phy.txt

  For other common properties, refer to
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pcie.txt
