  * AppliedMicro X-Gene PCIe interface

  Required properties:
  - device_type: set to "pci"
  - compatible: should contain "apm,xgene-pcie" to identify the core.
  - reg: A list of physical base address and length for each set of controller
         registers. Must contain an entry for each entry in the reg-names
         property.
  - reg-names: Must include the following entries:
    "csr": controller configuration registers.
    "cfg": PCIe configuration space registers.
  - #address-cells: set to <3>
  - #size-cells: set to <2>
  - ranges: ranges for the outbound memory, I/O regions.
  - dma-ranges: ranges for the inbound memory regions.
  - #interrupt-cells: set to <1>
  - interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: standard PCI properties
  	to define the mapping of the PCIe interface to interrupt
  	numbers.
  - clocks: from common clock binding: handle to pci clock.

  Optional properties:
  - status: Either "ok" or "disabled".
  - dma-coherent: Present if DMA operations are coherent
