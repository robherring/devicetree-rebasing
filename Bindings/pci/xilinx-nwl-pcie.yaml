  * Xilinx NWL PCIe Root Port Bridge DT description

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain "xlnx,nwl-pcie-2.11"
  - #address-cells: Address representation for root ports, set to <3>
  - #size-cells: Size representation for root ports, set to <2>
  - #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  	interrupt source. The value must be 1.
  - reg: Should contain Bridge, PCIe Controller registers location,
  	configuration space, and length
  - reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  	"breg": bridge registers
  	"pcireg": PCIe controller registers
  	"cfg": configuration space region
  - device_type: must be "pci"
  - interrupts: Should contain NWL PCIe interrupt
  - interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
  	"msi1, msi0": interrupt asserted when an MSI is received
  	"intx": interrupt asserted when a legacy interrupt is received
  	"misc": interrupt asserted when miscellaneous interrupt is received
  - interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: standard PCI properties to define the
  	mapping of the PCI interface to interrupt numbers.
  - ranges: ranges for the PCI memory regions (I/O space region is not
  	supported by hardware)
  	Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more
  	detailed explanation
  - msi-controller: indicates that this is MSI controller node
  - msi-parent:  MSI parent of the root complex itself
  - legacy-interrupt-controller: Interrupt controller device node for Legacy
  	interrupts
  	- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  	- #interrupt-cells: should be set to 1
  	- #address-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  		address. The value must be 0.
