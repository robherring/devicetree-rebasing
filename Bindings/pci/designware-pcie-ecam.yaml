  In some cases, firmware may already have configured the Synopsys DesignWare
  PCIe controller in RC mode with static ATU window mappings that cover all
  config, MMIO and I/O spaces in a [mostly] ECAM compatible fashion.
  In this case, there is no need for the OS to perform any low level setup
  of clocks, PHYs or device registers, nor is there any reason for the driver
  to reconfigure ATU windows for config and/or IO space accesses at runtime.

  In cases where the IP was synthesized with a minimum ATU window size of
  64 KB, it cannot be supported by the generic ECAM driver, because it
  requires special config space accessors that filter accesses to device #1
  and beyond on the first bus.

  * Synopsys DesignWare PCIe root complex in ECAM shift mode

  In some cases, firmware may already have configured the Synopsys DesignWare
  PCIe controller in RC mode with static ATU window mappings that cover all
  config, MMIO and I/O spaces in a [mostly] ECAM compatible fashion.
  In this case, there is no need for the OS to perform any low level setup
  of clocks, PHYs or device registers, nor is there any reason for the driver
  to reconfigure ATU windows for config and/or IO space accesses at runtime.

  In cases where the IP was synthesized with a minimum ATU window size of
  64 KB, it cannot be supported by the generic ECAM driver, because it
  requires special config space accessors that filter accesses to device #1
  and beyond on the first bus.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "marvell,armada8k-pcie-ecam" or
                "socionext,synquacer-pcie-ecam" or
                "snps,dw-pcie-ecam" (must be preceded by a more specific match)

  Please refer to the binding document of "pci-host-ecam-generic" in the
  file host-generic-pci.txt for a description of the remaining required
  and optional properties.
