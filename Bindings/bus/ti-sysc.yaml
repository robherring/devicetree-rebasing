title: Texas Instruments sysc interconnect target module wrapper binding

maintainers:
  - Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>
description: |+
  Texas Instruments SoCs can have a generic interconnect target module
  hardware for devices connected to various interconnects such as L3
  interconnect (Arteris NoC) and L4 interconnect (Sonics s3220). The sysc
  is mostly used for interaction between module and PRCM. It participates
  in the OCP Disconnect Protocol but other than that is mostly independent
  of the interconnect.

  Each interconnect target module can have one or more devices connected to
  it. There is a set of control registers for managing interconnect target
  module clocks, idle modes and interconnect level resets for the module.

  These control registers are sprinkled into the unused register address
  space of the first child device IP block managed by the interconnect
  target module and typically are named REVISION, SYSCONFIG and SYSSTATUS.

  Texas Instruments SoCs can have a generic interconnect target module

  Each interconnect target module can have one or more devices connected to

  module clocks, idle modes and interconnect level resets for the module.

  These control registers are sprinkled into the unused register address
  space of the first child device IP block managed by the interconnect
  target module and typically are named REVISION, SYSCONFIG and SYSSTATUS.

  Required standard properties:

  - compatible	shall be one of the following generic types:

  		"ti,sysc"
  		"ti,sysc-omap2"
  		"ti,sysc-omap4"
  		"ti,sysc-omap4-simple"

  		or one of the following derivative types for hardware
  		needing special workarounds:

  		"ti,sysc-omap2-timer"
  		"ti,sysc-omap4-timer"
  		"ti,sysc-omap3430-sr"
  		"ti,sysc-omap3630-sr"
  		"ti,sysc-omap4-sr"
  		"ti,sysc-omap3-sham"
  		"ti,sysc-omap-aes"
  		"ti,sysc-mcasp"
  		"ti,sysc-usb-host-fs"

  - reg		shall have register areas implemented for the interconnect
  		target module in question such as revision, sysc and syss

  - reg-names	shall contain the register names implemented for the
  		interconnect target module in question such as
  		"rev, "sysc", and "syss"

  - ranges	shall contain the interconnect target module IO range
  		available for one or more child device IP blocks managed
  		by the interconnect target module, the ranges may include
  		multiple ranges such as device L4 range for control and
  		parent L3 range for DMA access

  Optional properties:

  - ti,sysc-mask	shall contain mask of supported register bits for the
  		SYSCONFIG register as documented in the Technical Reference
  		Manual (TRM) for the interconnect target module

  - ti,sysc-midle	list of master idle modes supported by the interconnect
  		target module as documented in the TRM for SYSCONFIG
  		register MIDLEMODE bits

  - ti,sysc-sidle	list of slave idle modes supported by the interconnect
  		target module as documented in the TRM for SYSCONFIG
  		register SIDLEMODE bits

  - ti,sysc-delay-us	delay needed after OCP softreset before accssing
  			SYSCONFIG register again

  - ti,syss-mask	optional mask of reset done status bits as described in the
  		TRM for SYSSTATUS registers, typically 1 with some devices
  		having separate reset done bits for children like OHCI and
  		EHCI

  - clocks	clock specifier for each name in the clock-names as
  		specified in the binding documentation for ti-clkctrl,
  		typically available for all interconnect targets on TI SoCs
  		based on omap4 except if it's read-only register in hwauto
  		mode as for example omap4 L4_CFG_CLKCTRL

  - clock-names	should contain at least "fck", and optionally also "ick"
  		depending on the SoC and the interconnect target module

  - ti,hwmods	optional TI interconnect module name to use legacy
  		hwmod platform data

  - ti,no-reset-on-init	interconnect target module should not be reset at init

  - ti,no-idle-on-init	interconnect target module should not be idled at init
