  The Tegra ACONNECT bus is an AXI switch which is used to connnect various
  components inside the Audio Processing Engine (APE). All CPU accesses to
  the APE subsystem go through the ACONNECT via an APB to AXI wrapper.

  NVIDIA Tegra ACONNECT Bus

  The Tegra ACONNECT bus is an AXI switch which is used to connnect various
  components inside the Audio Processing Engine (APE). All CPU accesses to
  the APE subsystem go through the ACONNECT via an APB to AXI wrapper.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Must be "nvidia,tegra210-aconnect".
  - clocks: Must contain the entries for the APE clock (TEGRA210_CLK_APE),
    and APE interface clock (TEGRA210_CLK_APB2APE).
  - clock-names: Must contain the names "ape" and "apb2ape" for the corresponding
    'clocks' entries.
  - power-domains: Must contain a phandle that points to the audio powergate
    (namely 'aud') for Tegra210.
  - #address-cells: The number of cells used to represent physical base addresses
    in the aconnect address space. Should be 1.
  - #size-cells: The number of cells used to represent the size of an address
    range in the aconnect address space. Should be 1.
  - ranges: Mapping of the aconnect address space to the CPU address space.

  All devices accessed via the ACONNNECT are described by child-nodes.
