description: |+
  The Samsung Exynos542x SoC has NoC (Network on Chip) Probe for NoC bus.
  NoC provides the primitive values to get the performance data. The packets
  that the Network on Chip (NoC) probes detects are transported over
  the network infrastructure to observer units. You can configure probes to
  capture packets with header or data on the data request response network,
  or as traffic debug or statistic collectors. Exynos542x bus has multiple
  NoC probes to provide bandwidth information about behavior of the SoC
  that you can use while analyzing system performance.

  * Samsung Exynos NoC (Network on Chip) Probe device

  The Samsung Exynos542x SoC has NoC (Network on Chip) Probe for NoC bus.
  NoC provides the primitive values to get the performance data. The packets
  that the Network on Chip (NoC) probes detects are transported over
  the network infrastructure to observer units. You can configure probes to

  NoC probes to provide bandwidth information about behavior of the SoC
  that you can use while analyzing system performance.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "samsung,exynos5420-nocp"
  - reg: physical base address of each NoC Probe and length of memory mapped region.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-names : the name of clock used by the NoC Probe, "nocp"
  - clocks : phandles for clock specified in "clock-names" property
