  Marvell Orion SPI device

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be on of the following:
      - "marvell,orion-spi" for the Orion, mv78x00, Kirkwood and Dove SoCs
      - "marvell,armada-370-spi", for the Armada 370 SoCs
      - "marvell,armada-375-spi", for the Armada 375 SoCs
      - "marvell,armada-380-spi", for the Armada 38x SoCs
      - "marvell,armada-390-spi", for the Armada 39x SoCs
      - "marvell,armada-xp-spi", for the Armada XP SoCs
  - reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
  	This property can optionally have additional entries to configure
  	the SPI direct access mode that some of the Marvell SoCs support
  	additionally to the normal indirect access (PIO) mode. The values
  	for the MBus "target" and "attribute" are defined in the Marvell
  	SoC "Functional Specifications" Manual in the chapter "Marvell
  	Core Processor Address Decoding".
  	The eight register sets following the control registers refer to
  	chip-select lines 0 through 7 respectively.
  - cell-index : Which of multiple SPI controllers is this.
  - clocks : pointers to the reference clocks for this device, the first
  	   one is the one used for the clock on the spi bus, the
  	   second one is optional and is the clock used for the
  	   functional part of the controller

  Optional properties:
  - interrupts : Is currently not used.
  - clock-names : names of used clocks, mandatory if the second clock is
  		used, the name must be "core", and "axi" (the latter
  		is only for Armada 7K/8K).
