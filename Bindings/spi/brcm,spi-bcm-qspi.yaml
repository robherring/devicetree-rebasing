description: |+
  The Broadcom SPI controller is a SPI master found on various SOCs, including
  BRCMSTB (BCM7XXX), Cygnus, NSP and NS2. The Broadcom Master SPI hw IP consits
  of :
   MSPI : SPI master controller can read and write to a SPI slave device
   BSPI : Broadcom SPI in combination with the MSPI hw IP provides acceleration
  	for flash reads and be configured to do single, double, quad lane
  	io with 3-byte and 4-byte addressing support.

   Supported Broadcom SoCs have one instance of MSPI+BSPI controller IP.
   MSPI master can be used wihout BSPI. BRCMSTB SoCs have an additional instance
   of a MSPI master without the BSPI to use with non flash slave devices that
   use SPI protocol.

   use SPI protocol.

  Required properties:

  - #address-cells:
      Must be <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.

  - #size-cells:
      Must be <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.

  - compatible:
      Must be one of :
      "brcm,spi-bcm-qspi", "brcm,spi-brcmstb-qspi" : MSPI+BSPI on BRCMSTB SoCs
      "brcm,spi-bcm-qspi", "brcm,spi-brcmstb-mspi" : Second Instance of MSPI
  						   BRCMSTB  SoCs
      "brcm,spi-bcm-qspi", "brcm,spi-nsp-qspi"     : MSPI+BSPI on Cygnus, NSP
      "brcm,spi-bcm-qspi", "brcm,spi-ns2-qspi"     : NS2 SoCs

  - reg:
      Define the bases and ranges of the associated I/O address spaces.
      The required range is MSPI controller registers.

  - reg-names:
      First name does not matter, but must be reserved for the MSPI controller
      register range as mentioned in 'reg' above, and will typically contain
      - "bspi_regs": BSPI register range, not required with compatible
  		   "spi-brcmstb-mspi"
      - "mspi_regs": MSPI register range is required for compatible strings
      - "intr_regs", "intr_status_reg" : Interrupt and status register for
        NSP, NS2, Cygnus SoC

  - interrupts
      The interrupts used by the MSPI and/or BSPI controller.

  - interrupt-names:
      Names of interrupts associated with MSPI
      - "mspi_halted" :
      - "mspi_done": Indicates that the requested SPI operation is complete.
      - "spi_lr_fullness_reached" : Linear read BSPI pipe full
      - "spi_lr_session_aborted"  : Linear read BSPI pipe aborted
      - "spi_lr_impatient" : Linear read BSPI requested when pipe empty
      - "spi_lr_session_done" : Linear read BSPI session done

  - clocks:
      A phandle to the reference clock for this block.

  Optional properties:


  - native-endian
      Defined when using BE SoC and device uses BE register read/write

  Recommended optional m25p80 properties:
  - spi-rx-bus-width: Definition as per
                      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
