description: |+
  ICP DAS LP-8841 contains a DS-1302 RTC. RTC is connected to an IO
  memory register, which acts as an SPI master device.

  The device uses the standard MicroWire half-duplex transfer timing.
  Master output is set on low clock and sensed by the RTC on the rising
  edge. Master input is set by the RTC on the trailing edge and is sensed
  by the master on low clock.

  * ICP DAS LP-8841 SPI Controller for RTC

  ICP DAS LP-8841 contains a DS-1302 RTC. RTC is connected to an IO
  memory register, which acts as an SPI master device.

  The device uses the standard MicroWire half-duplex transfer timing.
  Master output is set on low clock and sensed by the RTC on the rising
  edge. Master input is set by the RTC on the trailing edge and is sensed
  by the master on low clock.

  Required properties:

  - #address-cells: should be 1

  - #size-cells: should be 0

  - compatible: should be "icpdas,lp8841-spi-rtc"

  - reg: should provide IO memory address

  Requirements to SPI slave nodes:

  - There can be only one slave device.

  - The spi slave node should claim the following flags which are
    required by the spi controller.

    - spi-3wire: The master itself has only 3 wire. It cannor work in
      full duplex mode.

    - spi-cs-high: DS-1302 has active high chip select line. The master
      doesn't support active low.

    - spi-lsb-first: DS-1302 requires least significant bit first
      transfers. The master only support this type of bit ordering.
