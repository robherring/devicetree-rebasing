  Required properties
  - #address-cells: must be <1>
  - #size-cells: must be <0>
  - compatible: should include "cirrus,ep7209-spi"
  - reg: Address and length of one register range
  - interrupts: one interrupt line
  - clocks: One entry, refers to the SPI bus clock
  - cs-gpios: Specifies the gpio pins to be used for chipselects.
  	    See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

  An additional register is present in the system controller,
  which is assumed to be in the same device tree, with and marked
  as compatible with "cirrus,ep7209-syscon3".

  Example:

  spi@80000500 {
  	#address-cells = <1>;
  	#size-cells = <0>;
  	compatible = "cirrus,ep7209-spi";
  	reg = <0x80000500 0x4>;
  	interrupts = <15>;
  	clocks = <&clks CLPS711X_CLK_SPI>;
  };

  syscon3: syscon@80002200 {
  	compatible = "cirrus,ep7209-syscon3", "syscon";
  	reg = <0x80002200 0x40>;
  };
