  Required properties:
  - compatible : For Tegra114, must contain "nvidia,tegra114-spi".
    Otherwise, must contain '"nvidia,<chip>-spi", "nvidia,tegra114-spi"' where
    <chip> is tegra124, tegra132, or tegra210.
  - reg: Should contain SPI registers location and length.
  - interrupts: Should contain SPI interrupts.
  - clock-names : Must include the following entries:
    - spi
  - resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names : Must include the following entries:
    - spi
  - dmas : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../dma/dma.txt for details.
  - dma-names : Must include the following entries:
    - rx
    - tx
  - clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
