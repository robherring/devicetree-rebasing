  TI QSPI controller.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "ti,dra7xxx-qspi" or "ti,am4372-qspi".
  - reg: Should contain QSPI registers location and length.
  - reg-names: Should contain the resource reg names.
  	- qspi_base: Qspi configuration register Address space
  	- qspi_mmap: Memory mapped Address space
  	- (optional) qspi_ctrlmod: Control module Address space
  - interrupts: should contain the qspi interrupt number.
  - #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  - ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated to the QSPI

  Recommended properties:
  - spi-max-frequency: Definition as per
                       Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

  Optional properties:
  - syscon-chipselects: Handle to system control region contains QSPI
  		      chipselect register and offset of that register.

  NOTE: TI QSPI controller requires different pinmux and IODelay
  parameters for Mode-0 and Mode-3 operations, which needs to be set up by
  the bootloader (U-Boot). Default configuration only supports Mode-0
  operation. Hence, "spi-cpol" and "spi-cpha" DT properties cannot be
  specified in the slave nodes of TI QSPI controller without appropriate
  modification to bootloader.
