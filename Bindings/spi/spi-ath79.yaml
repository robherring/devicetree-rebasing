  Binding for Qualcomm Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx SPI controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: has to be "qca,<soc-type>-spi", "qca,ar7100-spi" as fallback.
  - reg: Base address and size of the controllers memory area
  - clocks: phandle of the AHB clock.
  - clock-names: has to be "ahb".
  - #address-cells: <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.
  - #size-cells: <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.

  Child nodes as per the generic SPI binding.
