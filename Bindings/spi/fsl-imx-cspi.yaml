  * Freescale (Enhanced) Configurable Serial Peripheral Interface
    (CSPI/eCSPI) for i.MX

  Required properties:
  - compatible :
    - "fsl,imx1-cspi" for SPI compatible with the one integrated on i.MX1
    - "fsl,imx21-cspi" for SPI compatible with the one integrated on i.MX21
    - "fsl,imx27-cspi" for SPI compatible with the one integrated on i.MX27
    - "fsl,imx31-cspi" for SPI compatible with the one integrated on i.MX31
    - "fsl,imx35-cspi" for SPI compatible with the one integrated on i.MX35
    - "fsl,imx51-ecspi" for SPI compatible with the one integrated on i.MX51
    - "fsl,imx53-ecspi" for SPI compatible with the one integrated on i.MX53 and later Soc
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupts : Should contain CSPI/eCSPI interrupt
  - clocks : Clock specifiers for both ipg and per clocks.
  - clock-names : Clock names should include both "ipg" and "per"
  See the clock consumer binding,
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Recommended properties:
  - cs-gpios : GPIOs to use as chip selects, see spi-bus.txt.  While the native chip
  select lines can be used, they appear to always generate a pulse between each
  word of a transfer.  Most use cases will require GPIO based chip selects to
  generate a valid transaction.

  Optional properties:
  - num-cs :  Number of total chip selects, see spi-bus.txt.
  - dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt.
  - dma-names: DMA request names, if present, should include "tx" and "rx".
  - fsl,spi-rdy-drctl: Integer, representing the value of DRCTL, the register
  controlling the SPI_READY handling. Note that to enable the DRCTL consideration,
  the SPI_READY mode-flag needs to be set too.
  Valid values are: 0 (disabled), 1 (edge-triggered burst) and 2 (level-triggered burst).

  Obsolete properties:
  - fsl,spi-num-chipselects : Contains the number of the chipselect
