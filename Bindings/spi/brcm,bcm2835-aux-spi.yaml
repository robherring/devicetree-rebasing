  Broadcom BCM2835 auxiliar SPI1/2 controller

  The BCM2835 contains two forms of SPI master controller, one known simply as
  SPI0, and the other known as the "Universal SPI Master"; part of the
  auxiliary block. This binding applies to the SPI1/2 controller.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "brcm,bcm2835-aux-spi".
  - reg: Should contain register location and length for the spi block
  - interrupts: Should contain shared interrupt of the aux block
  - clocks: The clock feeding the SPI controller - needs to
  	  point to the auxiliar clock driver of the bcm2835,
  	  as this clock will enable the output gate for the specific
  	  clock.
  - cs-gpios: the cs-gpios (native cs is NOT supported)
  	    see also spi-bus.txt
