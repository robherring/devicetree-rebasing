  Davinci SPI controller device bindings

  Required properties:
  - #address-cells: number of cells required to define a chip select
  	address on the SPI bus. Should be set to 1.
  - #size-cells: should be zero.
  - compatible:
  	- "ti,dm6441-spi" for SPI used similar to that on DM644x SoC family
  	- "ti,da830-spi" for SPI used similar to that on DA8xx SoC family
  	- "ti,keystone-spi" for SPI used similar to that on Keystone2 SoC
  		family
  - reg: Offset and length of SPI controller register space
  - num-cs: Number of chip selects. This includes internal as well as
  	GPIO chip selects.
  - ti,davinci-spi-intr-line: interrupt line used to connect the SPI
  	IP to the interrupt controller within the SoC. Possible values
  	are 0 and 1. Manual says one of the two possible interrupt
  	lines can be tied to the interrupt controller. Set this
  	based on a specific SoC configuration.
  - interrupts: interrupt number mapped to CPU.
  - clocks: spi clk phandle
            For 66AK2G this property should be set per binding,
            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/ti,sci-clk.txt

  SoC-specific Required Properties:

  The following are mandatory properties for Keystone 2 66AK2G SoCs only:

  - power-domains:	Should contain a phandle to a PM domain provider node
  			and an args specifier containing the SPI device id
  			value. This property is as per the binding,

  Optional:
  - cs-gpios: gpio chip selects
  	For example to have 3 internal CS and 2 GPIO CS, user could define
  	cs-gpios = <0>, <0>, <0>, <&gpio1 30 0>, <&gpio1 31 0>;
  	where first three are internal CS and last two are GPIO CS.

  Optional properties for slave devices:
  SPI slave nodes can contain the following properties.
  Not all SPI Peripherals from Texas Instruments support this.
  Please check SPI peripheral documentation for a device before using these.

  - ti,spi-wdelay : delay between transmission of words
  	(SPIFMTn.WDELAY, SPIDAT1.WDEL) must be specified in number of SPI module
  	clock periods.

  	delay = WDELAY * SPI_module_clock_period + 2 * SPI_module_clock_period

  Below is timing diagram which shows functional meaning of
  "ti,spi-wdelay" parameter.
