  * Rockchip SPI Controller

  The Rockchip SPI controller is used to interface with various devices such as flash
  and display controllers using the SPI communication interface.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following.
      "rockchip,rv1108-spi" for rv1108 SoCs.
      "rockchip,rk3036-spi" for rk3036 SoCS.
      "rockchip,rk3066-spi" for rk3066 SoCs.
      "rockchip,rk3188-spi" for rk3188 SoCs.
      "rockchip,rk3228-spi" for rk3228 SoCS.
      "rockchip,rk3288-spi" for rk3288 SoCs.
      "rockchip,rk3368-spi" for rk3368 SoCs.
      "rockchip,rk3399-spi" for rk3399 SoCs.
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
         region.
  - interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
                depends on the interrupt controller.
  - clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: Shall be "spiclk" for the transfer-clock, and "apb_pclk" for
  			   the peripheral clock.
  - #address-cells: should be 1.
  - #size-cells: should be 0.

  Optional Properties:

  - dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
  		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
  - dma-names: DMA request names should include "tx" and "rx" if present.
  - rx-sample-delay-ns: nanoseconds to delay after the SCLK edge before sampling
  		Rx data (may need to be fine tuned for high capacitance lines).
  		No delay (0) by default.
  - pinctrl-names: Names for the pin configuration(s); may be "default" or
  		"sleep", where the "sleep" configuration may describe the state
  		the pins should be in during system suspend. See also
  		pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.
