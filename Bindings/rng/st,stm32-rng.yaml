  STMicroelectronics STM32 HW RNG
  ===============================

  The STM32 hardware random number generator is a simple fixed purpose IP and
  is fully separated from other crypto functions.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : Should be "st,stm32-rng"
  - reg : Should be register base and length as documented in the datasheet
  - interrupts : The designated IRQ line for the RNG
  - clocks : The clock needed to enable the RNG
