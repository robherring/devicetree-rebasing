  HWRNG support for the timeriomem_rng driver

  Required properties:
  - compatible : "timeriomem_rng"
  - reg : base address to sample from
  - period : wait time in microseconds to use between samples

  Optional properties:
  - quality : estimated number of bits of true entropy per 1024 bits read from the
              rng.  Defaults to zero which causes the kernel's default quality to
              be used instead.  Note that the default quality is usually zero
              which disables using this rng to automatically fill the kernel's
              entropy pool.

  N.B. currently 'reg' must be four bytes wide and aligned
