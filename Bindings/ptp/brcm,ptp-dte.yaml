  * Broadcom Digital Timing Engine(DTE) based PTP clock

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should contain the core compatibility string
                and the SoC compatibility string. The SoC
                compatibility string is to handle SoC specific
                hardware differences.
                Core compatibility string:
                   "brcm,ptp-dte"
                SoC compatibility strings:
                   "brcm,iproc-ptp-dte" - for iproc based SoC's
  - reg: address and length of the DTE block's NCO registers
