  OpenRISC Generic SoC
  ====================

  Boards and FPGA SoC's which support the OpenRISC standard platform.  The
  platform essentially follows the conventions of the OpenRISC architecture
  specification, however some aspects, such as the boot protocol have been defined
  by the Linux port.

  Required properties
  -------------------
   - compatible: Must include "opencores,or1ksim"

  CPU nodes:
  ----------
  A "cpus" node is required.  Required properties:
   - #address-cells: Must be 1.
   - #size-cells: Must be 0.
  A CPU sub-node is also required for at least CPU 0.  Since the topology may
  be probed via CPS, it is not necessary to specify secondary CPUs.  Required
  properties:
   - compatible: Must be "opencores,or1200-rtlsvn481".
   - reg: CPU number.
   - clock-frequency: The CPU clock frequency in Hz.
