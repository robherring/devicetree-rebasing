  Marvell 88PM800 regulator

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "marvell,88pm800"
  - reg: I2C slave address
  - regulators: A node that houses a sub-node for each regulator within the
    device. Each sub-node is identified using the node's name (or the deprecated
    regulator-compatible property if present), with valid values listed below.
    The content of each sub-node is defined by the standard binding for
    regulators; see regulator.txt.

  The valid names for regulators are:

    buck1, buck2, buck3, buck4, buck5, ldo1, ldo2, ldo3, ldo4, ldo5, ldo6, ldo7,
    ldo8, ldo9, ldo10, ldo11, ldo12, ldo13, ldo14, ldo15, ldo16, ldo17, ldo18, ldo19

...
