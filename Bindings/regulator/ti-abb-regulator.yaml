  Adaptive Body Bias(ABB) SoC internal LDO regulator for Texas Instruments SoCs

  Required Properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of:
    - "ti,abb-v1" for older SoCs like OMAP3
    - "ti,abb-v2" for newer SoCs like OMAP4, OMAP5
    - "ti,abb-v3" for a generic definition where setup and control registers are
       provided (example: DRA7)
  - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
    the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names
    - "base-address"	- contains base address of ABB module (ti,abb-v1,ti,abb-v2)
    - "control-address"	- contains control register address of ABB module (ti,abb-v3)
    - "setup-address"	- contains setup register address of ABB module (ti,abb-v3)
    - "int-address"	- contains address of interrupt register for ABB module
    (also see Optional properties)
  - #address-cells: should be 0
  - #size-cells: should be 0
  - clocks: should point to the clock node used by ABB module
  - ti,settling-time: Settling time in uSecs from SoC documentation for ABB module
  	to settle down(target time for SR2_WTCNT_VALUE).
  - ti,clock-cycles: SoC specific data about count of system ti,clock-cycles used for
  	computing settling time from SoC Documentation for ABB module(clock
  	cycles for SR2_WTCNT_VALUE).
  - ti,tranxdone-status-mask: Mask to the int-register to write-to-clear mask
  	indicating LDO tranxdone (operation complete).
  - ti,abb_info: An array of 6-tuples u32 items providing information about ABB
  	configuration needed per operational voltage of the device.
  	Each item consists of the following in the same order:
  	volt: voltage in uV - Only used to index ABB information.
  	ABB mode: one of the following:
  		0-bypass
  		1-Forward Body Bias(FBB)
  		3-Reverse Body Bias(RBB)
  	efuse:	(see Optional properties)
  	RBB enable efuse Mask:	(See Optional properties)
  	FBB enable efuse Mask:	(See Optional properties)
  	Vset value efuse Mask:	(See Optional properties)

  	NOTE: If more than 1 entry is present, then regulator is setup to change
  	      voltage, allowing for various modes to be selected indexed off
  	      the regulator. Further, ABB LDOs are considered always-on by
  	      default.

  Optional Properties:
  - reg-names: In addition to the required properties, the following are optional
    - "efuse-address"	- Contains efuse base address used to pick up ABB info.
    - "ldo-address"	- Contains address of ABB LDO override register.
  	"efuse-address" is required for this.
  - ti,ldovbb-vset-mask	- Required if ldo-address is set, mask for LDO override
  	register to provide override vset value.
  - ti,ldovbb-override-mask - Required if ldo-address is set, mask for LDO
  	override register to enable override vset value.
  - ti,abb_opp_sel: Addendum to the description in required properties
  	efuse: Mandatory if 'efuse-address' register is defined. Provides offset
  	       from efuse-address to pick up ABB characteristics. Set to 0 if
  	       'efuse-address' is not defined.
  	RBB enable efuse Mask:	Optional if 'efuse-address' register is defined.
  		'ABB mode' is force set to RBB mode if value at "efuse-address"
  		+ efuse maps to RBB mask. Set to 0 to ignore this.
  	FBB enable efuse Mask:	Optional if 'efuse-address' register is defined.
  		'ABB mode' is force set to FBB mode if value at "efuse-address"
  		+ efuse maps to FBB mask (valid only if RBB mask does not match)
  		Set to 0 to ignore this.
  	Vset value efuse Mask:	Mandatory if ldo-address is set. Picks up from
  		efuse the value to set in 'ti,ldovbb-vset-mask' at ldo-address.
