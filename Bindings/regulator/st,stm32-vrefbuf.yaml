  Some STM32 devices embed a voltage reference buffer which can be used as
  voltage reference for ADCs, DACs and also as voltage reference for external
  components through the dedicated VREF+ pin.

  STM32 VREFBUF - Voltage reference buffer

  Some STM32 devices embed a voltage reference buffer which can be used as
  voltage reference for ADCs, DACs and also as voltage reference for external
  components through the dedicated VREF+ pin.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Must be "st,stm32-vrefbuf".
  - reg:			Offset and length of VREFBUF register set.
  - clocks:		Must contain an entry for peripheral clock.
