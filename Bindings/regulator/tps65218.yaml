  TPS65218 family of regulators

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "ti,tps65218"
  - reg: I2C slave address

  - List of regulators provided by this controller, must be named
    after their hardware counterparts: dcdc[1-6] and ldo1
  - This is the list of child nodes that specify the regulator
    initialization data for defined regulators. Not all regulators for the given
    device need to be present. The definition for each of these nodes is defined
    using the standard binding for regulators found at ./regulator.txt.

    The valid names for regulators are:
    tps65217: regulator-dcdc1, regulator-dcdc2, regulator-dcdc3, regulator-dcdc4,
    regulator-dcdc5, regulator-dcdc6, regulator-ldo1, regulator-ls3.
    Each regulator is defined using the standard binding for regulators.
