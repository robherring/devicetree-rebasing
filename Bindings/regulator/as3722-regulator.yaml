  Regulator of AMS AS3722 PMIC.
  Name of the regulator subnode must be "regulators".

  Optional properties:
  --------------------
  The input supply of regulators are the optional properties on the
  regulator node. The AS3722 is having 7 DCDC step-down regulators as
  sd[0-6], 10 LDOs as ldo[0-7], ldo[9-11]. The input supply of these
  regulators are provided through following properties:
  vsup-sd2-supply: Input supply for SD2.
  vsup-sd3-supply: Input supply for SD3.
  vsup-sd4-supply: Input supply for SD4.
  vsup-sd5-supply: Input supply for SD5.
  vin-ldo0-supply: Input supply for LDO0.
  vin-ldo1-6-supply: Input supply for LDO1 and LDO6.
  vin-ldo2-5-7-supply: Input supply for LDO2, LDO5 and LDO7.
  vin-ldo3-4-supply: Input supply for LDO3 and LDO4.
  vin-ldo9-10-supply: Input supply for LDO9 and LDO10.
  vin-ldo11-supply: Input supply for LDO11.

  Optional nodes:
  --------------
  - regulators : Must contain a sub-node per regulator from the list below.
  	       Each sub-node should contain the constraints and initialization
  	       information for that regulator. See regulator.txt for a
  	       description of standard properties for these sub-nodes.
  	       Additional custom properties  are listed below.
  	       sd[0-6], ldo[0-7], ldo[9-11].

  	       Optional sub-node properties:
  	       ----------------------------
  		ams,ext-control: External control of the rail. The option of
  			this properties will tell which external input is
  			controlling this rail. Valid values are 0, 1, 2 ad 3.
  			0: There is no external control of this rail.
  			1: Rail is controlled by ENABLE1 input pin.
  			2: Rail is controlled by ENABLE2 input pin.
  			3: Rail is controlled by ENABLE3 input pin.
  		ams,enable-tracking: Enable tracking with SD1, only supported
  			by LDO3.
