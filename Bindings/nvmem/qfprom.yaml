    = Data consumers =
    Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

    For example:

    tsens {
      ...
      nvmem-cells = <&tsens_calibration>;
      nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
    };

  = Qualcomm QFPROM device tree bindings =

  This binding is intended to represent QFPROM which is found in most QCOM SOCs.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "qcom,qfprom"
  - reg: Should contain registers location and length

  = Data cells =
  Are child nodes of qfprom, bindings of which as described in
  bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt
