    = Data consumers =
    Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

    For example:

    thermal {
      ...
      nvmem-cells = <&thermal_calibration>;
      nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";

  - reg: Should contain registers location and length

  = Data cells =
  Are child nodes of MTK-EFUSE, bindings of which as described in
