  Required properties :
  - compatible :
    - "fsl,imx23-ocotp" for i.MX23
    - "fsl,imx28-ocotp" for i.MX28
  - #address-cells : Should be 1
  - #size-cells : Should be 1
  - reg : Address and length of OTP controller registers
  - clocks : Should contain a reference to the hbus clock

  = Data cells =
  Are child nodes of mxs-ocotp, bindings of which as described in
  bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

  Example for i.MX28:

  	ocotp: ocotp@8002c000 {
  		compatible = "fsl,imx28-ocotp", "fsl,ocotp";
  		#address-cells = <1>;
  		#size-cells = <1>;
  		reg = <0x8002c000 0x2000>;
  		clocks = <&clks 25>;
  	};
