description: |+
  The Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter (ASRC) converts the sampling rate of a
  signal associated with an input clock into a signal associated with a different
  output clock. The driver currently works as a Front End of DPCM with other Back
  Ends Audio controller such as ESAI, SSI and SAI. It has three pairs to support
  three substreams within totally 10 channels.

  Freescale Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter (ASRC) Controller

  The Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter (ASRC) converts the sampling rate of a
  signal associated with an input clock into a signal associated with a different
  output clock. The driver currently works as a Front End of DPCM with other Back
  Ends Audio controller such as ESAI, SSI and SAI. It has three pairs to support
  three substreams within totally 10 channels.

  Required properties:

    - compatible		: Contains "fsl,imx35-asrc" or "fsl,imx53-asrc".

    - reg			: Offset and length of the register set for the device.

    - interrupts		: Contains the spdif interrupt.

    - dmas		: Generic dma devicetree binding as described in
  			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt.

    - dma-names		: Contains "rxa", "rxb", "rxc", "txa", "txb" and "txc".

    - clocks		: Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names.

    - clock-names		: Contains the following entries
  	"mem"		  Peripheral access clock to access registers.
  	"ipg"		  Peripheral clock to driver module.
  	"asrck_<0-f>"	  Clock sources for input and output clock.
  	"spba"		  The spba clock is required when ASRC is placed as a
  			  bus slave of the Shared Peripheral Bus and when two
  			  or more bus masters (CPU, DMA or DSP) try to access
  			  it. This property is optional depending on the SoC
  			  design.

     - big-endian		: If this property is absent, the little endian mode
  			  will be in use as default. Otherwise, the big endian
  			  mode will be in use for all the device registers.

     - fsl,asrc-rate	: Defines a mutual sample rate used by DPCM Back Ends.

     - fsl,asrc-width	: Defines a mutual sample width used by DPCM Back Ends.
