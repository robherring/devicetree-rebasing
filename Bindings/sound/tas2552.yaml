  Texas Instruments - tas2552 Codec module

  The tas2552 serial control bus communicates through I2C protocols

  Required properties:
  	- compatible - One of:
  		"ti,tas2552" - TAS2552
  	- reg -  I2C slave address: it can be 0x40 if ADDR pin is 0
  				    or 0x41 if ADDR pin is 1.
  	- supply-*: Required supply regulators are:
  		"vbat"		battery voltage
  		"iovdd"		I/O Voltage
  		"avdd"		Analog DAC Voltage

  Optional properties:
  	- enable-gpio - gpio pin to enable/disable the device

  tas2552 can receive its reference clock via MCLK, BCLK, IVCLKIN pin or use the
  internal 1.8MHz. This CLKIN is used by the PLL. In addition to PLL, the PDM
  reference clock is also selectable: PLL, IVCLKIN, BCLK or MCLK.
  For system integration the dt-bindings/sound/tas2552.h header file provides
  defined values to select and configure the PLL and PDM reference clocks.
