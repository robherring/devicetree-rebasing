  This device supports I2C only.

  Required properties:
    - compatible : Must be "adi,ssm2518"
    - reg : the I2C address of the device. This will either be 0x34 (ADDR pin low)
  	or 0x35 (ADDR pin high)

  Optional properties:
    - gpios : GPIO connected to the nSD pin. If the property is not present it is
  	        assumed that the nSD pin is hardwired to always on.
