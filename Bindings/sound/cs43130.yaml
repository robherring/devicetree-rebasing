  CS43130 DAC

  Required properties:

    - compatible : "cirrus,cs43130", "cirrus,cs4399", "cirrus,cs43131",
                   "cirrus,cs43198"

    - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

    - VA-supply, VP-supply, VL-supply, VCP-supply, VD-supply:
  	power supplies for the device, as covered in
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.


  Optional properties:

    - reset-gpios : Active low GPIO used to reset the device

    - cirrus,xtal-ibias:
     When external MCLK is generated by external crystal
     oscillator, CS43130 can be used to provide bias current
     for external crystal.  Amount of bias current sent is
     set as:
     1 = 7.5uA
     2 = 12.5uA
     3 = 15uA

    - cirrus,dc-measure:
     Boolean, define to enable headphone DC impedance measurement.

    - cirrus,ac-measure:
     Boolean, define to enable headphone AC impedance measurement.
     DC impedance must also be enabled for AC impedance measurement.

    - cirrus,dc-threshold:
     Define 2 DC impedance thresholds in ohms for HP output control.
     Default values are 50 and 120 Ohms.

    - cirrus,ac-freq:
     Define the frequencies at which to measure HP AC impedance.
     Only used if "cirrus,dc-measure" is defined.
     Exactly 10 frequencies must be defined.
     If this properties is undefined, by default,
     following frequencies are used:
     <24 43 93 200 431 928 2000 4309 9283 20000>
     The above frequencies are logarithmically equally spaced.
     Log base is 10.
