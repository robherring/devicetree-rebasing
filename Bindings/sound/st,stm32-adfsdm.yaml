  The DFSDM allows PDM microphones capture through SPI interface. The Audio
  interface is seems as a sub block of the DFSDM device.

  STMicroelectronics Audio Digital Filter Sigma Delta modulators(DFSDM)

  The DFSDM allows PDM microphones capture through SPI interface. The Audio
  interface is seems as a sub block of the DFSDM device.
  For details on DFSDM bindings refer to ../iio/adc/st,stm32-dfsdm-adc.txt

  Required properties:
    - compatible: "st,stm32h7-dfsdm-dai".

    - #sound-dai-cells : Must be equal to 0

    - io-channels : phandle to iio dfsdm instance node.
