  * Allwinner A10 I2S controller

  The I2S bus (Inter-IC sound bus) is a serial link for digital
  audio data transfer between devices in the system.

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following:
     - "allwinner,sun4i-a10-i2s"
     - "allwinner,sun6i-a31-i2s"
     - "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-i2s"
     - "allwinner,sun8i-h3-i2s"
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupts: should contain the I2S interrupt.
  - dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
  - dma-names: should include "tx" and "rx".
  - clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: should contain the following:
     - "apb" : clock for the I2S bus interface
     - "mod" : module clock for the I2S controller
  - #sound-dai-cells : Must be equal to 0

  Required properties for the following compatibles:
  	- "allwinner,sun6i-a31-i2s"
  	- "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-i2s"
  	- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-i2s"
  - resets: phandle to the reset line for this codec
