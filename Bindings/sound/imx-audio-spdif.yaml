  Freescale i.MX audio complex with S/PDIF transceiver

  Required properties:

    - compatible		: "fsl,imx-audio-spdif"

    - model		: The user-visible name of this sound complex

    - spdif-controller	: The phandle of the i.MX S/PDIF controller


  Optional properties:

    - spdif-out		: This is a boolean property. If present, the
  			  transmitting function of S/PDIF will be enabled,
  			  indicating there's a physical S/PDIF out connector
  			  or jack on the board or it's connecting to some
  			  other IP block, such as an HDMI encoder or
  			  display-controller.

    - spdif-in		: This is a boolean property. If present, the receiving
  			  function of S/PDIF will be enabled, indicating there
  			  is a physical S/PDIF in connector/jack on the board.

  * Note: At least one of these two properties should be set in the DT binding.
