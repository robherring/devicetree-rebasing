  ROCKCHIP RK3288 with HDMI and analog audio

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-hdmi-analog"
  - rockchip,model: The user-visible name of this sound complex
  - rockchip,i2s-controller: The phandle of the Rockchip I2S controller that's
    connected to the CODEC
  - rockchip,audio-codec: The phandle of the analog audio codec.
  - rockchip,routing: A list of the connections between audio components.
  		    Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
  		    connection's sink, the second being the connection's
  		    source. For this driver the first string should always be
  		    "Analog".

  Optionnal properties:
  - rockchip,hp-en-gpios = The phandle of the GPIO that power up/down the
    headphone (when the analog output is an headphone).
  - rockchip,hp-det-gpios = The phandle of the GPIO that detects the headphone
    (when the analog output is an headphone).
  - pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0: Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt
