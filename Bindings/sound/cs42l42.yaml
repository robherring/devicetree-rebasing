  CS42L42 audio CODEC

  Required properties:

    - compatible : "cirrus,cs42l42"

    - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C.

    - VP-supply, VCP-supply, VD_FILT-supply, VL-supply, VA-supply :
    power supplies for the device, as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

  Optional properties:

    - reset-gpios : a GPIO spec for the reset pin. If specified, it will be
    deasserted before communication to the codec starts.

    - interrupt-parent : Specifies the phandle of the interrupt controller to
    which the IRQs from CS42L42 are delivered to.

    - interrupts : IRQ line info CS42L42.
    (See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
    for further information relating to interrupt properties)

    - cirrus,ts-inv : Boolean property. For jacks that invert the tip sense
    polarity. Normal jacks will short tip sense pin to HS1 when headphones are
    plugged in and leave tip sense floating when not plugged in. Inverting jacks
    short tip sense when unplugged and float when plugged in.

    0 = (Default) Non-inverted
    1 = Inverted

    - cirrus,ts-dbnc-rise : Debounce the rising edge of TIP_SENSE_PLUG. With no
    debounce, the tip sense pin might be noisy on a plug event.

    0 - 0ms,
    1 - 125ms,
    2 - 250ms,
    3 - 500ms,
    4 - 750ms,
    5 - (Default) 1s,
    6 - 1.25s,
    7 - 1.5s,

    - cirrus,ts-dbnc-fall : Debounce the falling edge of TIP_SENSE_UNPLUG.
    With no debounce, the tip sense pin might be noisy on an unplug event.

    0 - 0ms,
    1 - 125ms,
    2 - 250ms,
    3 - 500ms,
    4 - 750ms,
    5 - (Default) 1s,
    6 - 1.25s,
    7 - 1.5s,

    - cirrus,btn-det-init-dbnce : This sets how long the driver sleeps after
    enabling button detection interrupts. After auto-detection and before
    servicing button interrupts, the HS bias needs time to settle. If you
    don't wait, there is possibility for erroneous button interrupt.

    0ms - 200ms,
    Default = 100ms

    - cirrus,btn-det-event-dbnce : This sets how long the driver delays after
    receiving a button press interrupt. With level detect interrupts, you want
    to wait a small amount of time to make sure the button press is making a
    clean connection with the bias resistors.

    0ms - 20ms,
    Default = 10ms

    - cirrus,bias-lvls : For a level-detect headset button scheme, each button
    will bias the mic pin to a certain voltage. To determine which button was
    pressed, the driver will compare this biased voltage to sequential,
    decreasing voltages and will stop when a comparator is tripped,
    indicating a comparator voltage < bias voltage. This value represents a
    percentage of the internally generated HS bias voltage. For different
    hardware setups, a designer might want to tweak this. This is an array of
    descending values for the comparator voltage.

    Array of 4 values
    Each 0-63
    < x1 x2 x3 x4 >
    Default = < 15 8 4 1>
