  Bindings for I2S controller built into xtfpga Xtensa bitstreams.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: shall be "cdns,xtfpga-i2s".
  - reg: memory region (address and length) with device registers.
  - interrupts: interrupt for the device.
  - clocks: phandle to the clk used as master clock. I2S bus clock
    is derived from it.
