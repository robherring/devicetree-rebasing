  * Rockchip SPDIF transceiver

  The S/PDIF audio block is a stereo transceiver that allows the
  processor to receive and transmit digital audio via an coaxial cable or
  a fibre cable.

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following:
     - "rockchip,rk3066-spdif"
     - "rockchip,rk3188-spdif"
     - "rockchip,rk3228-spdif"
     - "rockchip,rk3288-spdif"
     - "rockchip,rk3328-spdif"
     - "rockchip,rk3366-spdif"
     - "rockchip,rk3368-spdif"
     - "rockchip,rk3399-spdif"
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupts: should contain the SPDIF interrupt.
  - dmas: DMA specifiers for tx dma. See the DMA client binding,
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
  - dma-names: should be "tx"
  - clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
    in clock-names.
  - clock-names: should contain following:
     - "hclk": clock for SPDIF controller
     - "mclk" : clock for SPDIF bus

  Required properties on RK3288:
    - rockchip,grf: the phandle of the syscon node for the general register
                     file (GRF)
