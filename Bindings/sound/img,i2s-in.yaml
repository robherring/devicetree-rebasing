  Imagination Technologies I2S Input Controller

  Required Properties:

    - compatible : Compatible list, must contain "img,i2s-in"

    - #sound-dai-cells : Must be equal to 0

    - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

    - clocks : Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names

    - clock-names : Must include the following entry:
  	"sys"	The system clock

    - dmas: Contains an entry for each entry in dma-names.

    - dma-names: Must include the following entry:
  	"rx"	Single DMA channel used by all active I2S channels

    - img,i2s-channels : Number of I2S channels instantiated in the I2S in block

  Optional Properties:

    - interrupts : Contains the I2S in interrupts. Depending on
  	the configuration, there may be no interrupts, one interrupt,
  	or an interrupt per I2S channel. For the case where there is
  	one interrupt per channel, the interrupts should be listed
  	in ascending channel order

    - resets: Contains a phandle to the I2S in reset signal

    - reset-names: Contains the reset signal name "rst"
