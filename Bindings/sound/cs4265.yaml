  CS4265 audio CODEC

  This device supports I2C only.

  Required properties:

    - compatible : "cirrus,cs4265"

    - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C. The I2C address depends on
            the state of the AD0 pin.  If AD0 is high, the i2c address is 0x4f.
            If it is low, the i2c address is 0x4e.

  Optional properties:

    - reset-gpios : a GPIO spec for the reset pin. If specified, it will be
  		 deasserted before communication to the codec starts.
