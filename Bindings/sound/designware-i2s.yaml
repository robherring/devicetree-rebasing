  DesignWare I2S controller

  Required properties:
   - compatible : Must be "snps,designware-i2s"
   - reg : Must contain the I2S core's registers location and length
   - clocks : Pairs of phandle and specifier referencing the controller's
     clocks. The controller expects one clock: the clock used as the sampling
     rate reference clock sample.
   - clock-names : "i2sclk" for the sample rate reference clock.
   - dmas: Pairs of phandle and specifier for the DMA channels that are used by
     the core. The core expects one or two dma channels: one for transmit and
     one for receive.
   - dma-names : "tx" for the transmit channel, "rx" for the receive channel.

  Optional properties:
   - interrupts: The interrupt line number for the I2S controller. Add this
     parameter if the I2S controller that you are using does not support DMA.
