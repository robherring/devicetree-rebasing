  STMicroelectronics STM32 SPI/I2S Controller

  The SPI/I2S block supports I2S/PCM protocols when configured on I2S mode.
  Only some SPI instances support I2S.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: Must be "st,stm32h7-i2s"
    - reg: Offset and length of the device's register set.
    - interrupts: Must contain the interrupt line id.
    - clocks: Must contain phandle and clock specifier pairs for each entry
  	in clock-names.
    - clock-names: Must contain "i2sclk", "pclk", "x8k" and "x11k".
  	"i2sclk": clock which feeds the internal clock generator
  	"pclk": clock which feeds the peripheral bus interface
  	"x8k": I2S parent clock for sampling rates multiple of 8kHz.
  	"x11k": I2S parent clock for sampling rates multiple of 11.025kHz.
    - dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma.
      See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/stm32-dma.txt.
    - dma-names: Identifier for each DMA request line. Must be "tx" and "rx".
    - pinctrl-names: should contain only value "default"
    - pinctrl-0: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-stm32.txt

  Optional properties:
    - resets: Reference to a reset controller asserting the reset controller

  The device node should contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint'
  node, according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
  graph.txt.
