  Freescale i.MX audio complex with ES8328 codec

  Required properties:
  - compatible       : "fsl,imx-audio-es8328"
  - model            : The user-visible name of this sound complex
  - ssi-controller   : The phandle of the i.MX SSI controller
  - jack-gpio        : Optional GPIO for headphone jack
  - audio-amp-supply : Power regulator for speaker amps
  - audio-codec      : The phandle of the ES8328 audio codec
  - audio-routing    : A list of the connections between audio components.
                       Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
  		     connection's sink, the second being the connection's
  		     source. Valid names could be power supplies, ES8328
  		     pins, and the jacks on the board:

  			Power supplies:
  			   * audio-amp

  			ES8328 pins:
  			   * LOUT1
  			   * LOUT2
  			   * ROUT1
  			   * ROUT2
  			   * LINPUT1
  			   * LINPUT2
  			   * RINPUT1
  			   * RINPUT2
  			   * Mic PGA

  			Board connectors:
  			   * Headphone
  			   * Speaker
  			   * Mic Jack
  - mux-int-port     : The internal port of the i.MX audio muxer (AUDMUX)
  - mux-ext-port     : The external port of the i.MX audio muxer (AUDMIX)

  Note: The AUDMUX port numbering should start at 1, which is consistent with
  hardware manual.
