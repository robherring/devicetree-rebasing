  STMicroelectronics STM32 S/PDIF receiver (SPDIFRX).

  The SPDIFRX peripheral, is designed to receive an S/PDIF flow compliant with
  IEC-60958 and IEC-61937.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: should be "st,stm32h7-spdifrx"
    - reg: cpu DAI IP base address and size
    - clocks: must contain an entry for kclk (used as S/PDIF signal reference)
    - clock-names: must contain "kclk"
    - interrupts: cpu DAI interrupt line
    - dmas: DMA specifiers for audio data DMA and iec control flow DMA
      See STM32 DMA bindings, Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/stm32-dma.txt
    - dma-names: two dmas have to be defined, "rx" and "rx-ctrl"

  Optional properties:
    - resets: Reference to a reset controller asserting the SPDIFRX

  The device node should contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint'
  node, according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
  graph.txt.
