  * Broadcom BCM2835 SoC I2S/PCM module

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "brcm,bcm2835-i2s"
  - reg: A list of base address and size entries:
  	* The first entry should cover the PCM registers
  	* The second entry should cover the PCM clock registers
  - dmas: List of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
  - dma-names: Identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
    These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.

    One of the DMA channels will be responsible for transmission (should be
    named "tx") and one for reception (should be named "rx").
