  The SAI is based on I2S module that used communicating with audio codecs,

  serial interfaces with frame synchronization such as I2S, AC97, TDM, and

  Freescale Synchronous Audio Interface (SAI).

  The SAI is based on I2S module that used communicating with audio codecs,
  which provides a synchronous audio interface that supports fullduplex
  serial interfaces with frame synchronization such as I2S, AC97, TDM, and
  codec/DSP interfaces.

  Required properties:

    - compatible		: Compatible list, contains "fsl,vf610-sai",
  			  "fsl,imx6sx-sai" or "fsl,imx6ul-sai"

    - reg			: Offset and length of the register set for the device.

    - clocks		: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.

    - clock-names		: Must include the "bus" for register access and
  			  "mclk1", "mclk2", "mclk3" for bit clock and frame
  			  clock providing.
    - dmas		: Generic dma devicetree binding as described in
  			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt.

    - dma-names		: Two dmas have to be defined, "tx" and "rx".

    - pinctrl-names	: Must contain a "default" entry.

    - pinctrl-NNN		: One property must exist for each entry in
  			  pinctrl-names. See ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
  			  for details of the property values.

    - big-endian		: Boolean property, required if all the FTM_PWM
  			  registers are big-endian rather than little-endian.

    - lsb-first		: Configures whether the LSB or the MSB is transmitted
  			  first for the fifo data. If this property is absent,
  			  the MSB is transmitted first as default, or the LSB
  			  is transmitted first.

    - fsl,sai-synchronous-rx: This is a boolean property. If present, indicating
  			  that SAI will work in the synchronous mode (sync Tx
  			  with Rx) which means both the transimitter and the
  			  receiver will send and receive data by following
  			  receiver's bit clocks and frame sync clocks.

    - fsl,sai-asynchronous: This is a boolean property. If present, indicating
  			  that SAI will work in the asynchronous mode, which
  			  means both transimitter and receiver will send and
  			  receive data by following their own bit clocks and
  			  frame sync clocks separately.

  Optional properties (for mx6ul):

    - fsl,sai-mclk-direction-output: This is a boolean property. If present,
  			 indicates that SAI will output the SAI MCLK clock.

  Note:
  - If both fsl,sai-asynchronous and fsl,sai-synchronous-rx are absent, the
    default synchronous mode (sync Rx with Tx) will be used, which means both
    transimitter and receiver will send and receive data by following clocks
    of transimitter.
  - fsl,sai-asynchronous and fsl,sai-synchronous-rx are exclusive.
