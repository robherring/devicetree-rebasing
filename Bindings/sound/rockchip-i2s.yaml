  * Rockchip I2S controller

  The I2S bus (Inter-IC sound bus) is a serial link for digital
  audio data transfer between devices in the system.

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following:
     - "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3066
     - "rockchip,rk3036-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3036
     - "rockchip,rk3188-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3188
     - "rockchip,rk3228-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3228
     - "rockchip,rk3288-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3288
     - "rockchip,rk3328-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3328
     - "rockchip,rk3366-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3366
     - "rockchip,rk3368-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3368
     - "rockchip,rk3399-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s": for rk3399
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupts: should contain the I2S interrupt.
  - dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
  - dma-names: should include "tx" and "rx".
  - clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: should contain the following:
     - "i2s_hclk": clock for I2S BUS
     - "i2s_clk" : clock for I2S controller
  - rockchip,playback-channels: max playback channels, if not set, 8 channels default.
  - rockchip,capture-channels: max capture channels, if not set, 2 channels default.

  Required properties for controller which support multi channels
  playback/capture:

  - rockchip,grf: the phandle of the syscon node for GRF register.
