  WM8962 audio CODEC

  This device supports I2C only.

  Required properties:

    - compatible : "wlf,wm8962"

    - reg : the I2C address of the device.

  Optional properties:
    - spk-mono: This is a boolean property. If present, the SPK_MONO bit
      of R51 (Class D Control 2) gets set, indicating that the speaker is
      in mono mode.

    - mic-cfg : Default register value for R48 (Additional Control 4).
      If absent, the default should be the register default.

    - gpio-cfg : A list of GPIO configuration register values. The list must
      be 6 entries long. If absent, no configuration of these registers is
      performed. And note that only the value within [0x0, 0xffff] is valid.
      Any other value is regarded as setting the GPIO register by its reset
      value 0x0.
