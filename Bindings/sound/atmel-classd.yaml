  * Atmel ClassD driver under ALSA SoC architecture

  Required properties:
  - compatible
  	Should be "atmel,sama5d2-classd".
  - reg
  	Should contain ClassD registers location and length.
  - interrupts
  	Should contain the IRQ line for the ClassD.
  - dmas
  	One DMA specifiers as described in atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
  - dma-names
  	Must be "tx".
  - clock-names
  	Tuple listing input clock names.
  	Required elements: "pclk" and "gclk".
  - clocks
  	Please refer to clock-bindings.txt.
  - assigned-clocks
  	Should be <&classd_gclk>.

  Optional properties:
  - pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0
  	Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt.
  - atmel,model
  	The user-visible name of this sound complex.
  	The default value is "CLASSD".
  - atmel,pwm-type
  	PWM modulation type, "single" or "diff".
  	The default value is "single".
  - atmel,non-overlap-time
  	Set non-overlapping time, the unit is nanosecond(ns).
  	There are four values,
  	<5>, <10>, <15>, <20>, the default value is <10>.
  	Non-overlapping will be disabled if not specified.
