title: Freescale Generic ASoC Sound Card with ASRC support

maintainers:

description: |+
  The Freescale Generic ASoC Sound Card can be used, ideally, for all Freescale
  SoCs connecting with external CODECs.

  The idea of this generic sound card is a bit like ASoC Simple Card. However,
  for Freescale SoCs (especially those released in recent years), most of them
  have ASRC (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/fsl,asrc.txt) inside. And
  this is a specific feature that might be painstakingly controlled and merged
  into the Simple Card.

  So having this generic sound card allows all Freescale SoC users to benefit
  from the simplification of a new card support and the capability of the wide
  sample rates support through ASRC.

  Note: The card is initially designed for those sound cards who use AC'97, I2S
        and PCM DAI formats. However, it'll be also possible to support those non
        AC'97/I2S/PCM type sound cards, such as S/PDIF audio and HDMI audio, as
        long as the driver has been properly upgraded.


  The compatible list for this generic sound card currently:
   "fsl,imx-audio-ac97"

   "fsl,imx-audio-cs42888"

   "fsl,imx-audio-cs427x"
   (compatible with CS4271 and CS4272)

   "fsl,imx-audio-wm8962"
   (compatible with Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/imx-audio-wm8962.txt)

   "fsl,imx-audio-sgtl5000"
   (compatible with Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/imx-audio-sgtl5000.txt)

  Required properties:

    - compatible		: Contains one of entries in the compatible list.

    - model		: The user-visible name of this sound complex

    - audio-cpu		: The phandle of an CPU DAI controller

    - audio-codec		: The phandle of an audio codec

    - audio-routing	: A list of the connections between audio components.
  			  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
  			  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
  			  source. There're a few pre-designed board connectors:
  			   * Line Out Jack
  			   * Line In Jack
  			   * Headphone Jack
  			   * Mic Jack
  			   * Ext Spk
  			   * AMIC (stands for Analog Microphone Jack)
  			   * DMIC (stands for Digital Microphone Jack)

  			  Note: The "Mic Jack" and "AMIC" are redundant while
  			        coexisting in order to support the old bindings
  				of wm8962 and sgtl5000.

  Optional properties:

    - audio-asrc		: The phandle of ASRC. It can be absent if there's no
  			  need to add ASRC support via DPCM.

  Optional unless SSI is selected as a CPU DAI:

    - mux-int-port	: The internal port of the i.MX audio muxer (AUDMUX)

    - mux-ext-port	: The external port of the i.MX audio muxer
