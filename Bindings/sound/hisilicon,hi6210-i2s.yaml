  * Hisilicon 6210 i2s controller

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following:
     - "hisilicon,hi6210-i2s"
  - reg: physical base address of the i2s controller unit and length of
     memory mapped region.
  - interrupts: should contain the i2s interrupt.
  - clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
    in clock-names.
  - clock-names: should contain following:
     - "dacodec"
     - "i2s-base"
  - dmas: DMA specifiers for tx dma. See the DMA client binding,
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
  - dma-names: should be "tx" and "rx"
  - hisilicon,sysctrl-syscon: phandle to sysctrl syscon
  - #sound-dai-cells: Should be set to 1 (for multi-dai)
     - The dai cell indexes reference the following interfaces:
         0: S2 interface
         (Currently that is the only one available, but more may be
          supported in the future)
