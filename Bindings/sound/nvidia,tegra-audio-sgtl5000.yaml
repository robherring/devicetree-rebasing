  NVIDIA Tegra audio complex, with SGTL5000 CODEC

  Required properties:
  - compatible : "nvidia,tegra-audio-sgtl5000"
  - clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names : Must include the following entries:
    - pll_a
    - pll_a_out0
    - mclk (The Tegra cdev1/extern1 clock, which feeds the CODEC's mclk)
  - nvidia,model : The user-visible name of this sound complex.
  - nvidia,audio-routing : A list of the connections between audio components.
    Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink,
    the second being the connection's source. Valid names for sources and
    sinks are the SGTL5000's pins (as documented in its binding), and the jacks
    on the board:

    * Headphone Jack
    * Line In Jack
    * Mic Jack

  - nvidia,i2s-controller : The phandle of the Tegra I2S controller that's
    connected to the CODEC.
