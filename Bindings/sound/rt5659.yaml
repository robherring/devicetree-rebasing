  RT5659/RT5658 audio CODEC

  This device supports I2C only.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : One of "realtek,rt5659" or "realtek,rt5658".

  - reg : The I2C address of the device.

  - interrupts : The CODEC's interrupt output.

  Optional properties:

  - clocks: The phandle of the master clock to the CODEC
  - clock-names: Should be "mclk"

  - realtek,in1-differential
  - realtek,in3-differential
  - realtek,in4-differential
    Boolean. Indicate MIC1/3/4 input are differential, rather than single-ended.

  - realtek,dmic1-data-pin
    0: dmic1 is not used
    1: using IN2N pin as dmic1 data pin
    2: using GPIO5 pin as dmic1 data pin
    3: using GPIO9 pin as dmic1 data pin
    4: using GPIO11 pin as dmic1 data pin

  - realtek,dmic2-data-pin
    0: dmic2 is not used
    1: using IN2P pin as dmic2 data pin
    2: using GPIO6 pin as dmic2 data pin
    3: using GPIO10 pin as dmic2 data pin
    4: using GPIO12 pin as dmic2 data pin

  - realtek,jd-src
    0: No JD is used
    1: using JD3 as JD source

  - realtek,ldo1-en-gpios : The GPIO that controls the CODEC's LDO1_EN pin.
  - realtek,reset-gpios : The GPIO that controls the CODEC's RESET pin.
