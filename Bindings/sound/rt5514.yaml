          number for SPI.

  Optional properties:

  - clocks: The phandle of the master clock to the CODEC
  - clock-names: Should be "mclk"

  - interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller.
  - interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
  	      depends on the interrupt controller.
