  RT5514 audio CODEC

  This device supports both I2C and SPI.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : "realtek,rt5514".

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C, the chip select
          number for SPI.

  Optional properties:

  - clocks: The phandle of the master clock to the CODEC
  - clock-names: Should be "mclk"

  - interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller.
  - interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
  	      depends on the interrupt controller.

  - realtek,dmic-init-delay-ms
    Set the DMIC initial delay (ms) to wait it ready for I2C.

  Pins on the device (for linking into audio routes) for I2C:

    * DMIC1L
    * DMIC1R
    * DMIC2L
    * DMIC2R
    * AMICL
    * AMICR
