title: Generic OPP (Operating Performance Points) Bindings

description: |+
  Devices work at voltage-current-frequency combinations and some implementations
  have the liberty of choosing these. These combinations are called Operating
  Performance Points aka OPPs. This document defines bindings for these OPPs
  applicable across wide range of devices. For illustration purpose, this document
  uses CPU as a device.

  This document contain multiple versions of OPP binding and only one of them
  should be used per device.

  Binding 1: operating-points
  ============================

  This binding only supports voltage-frequency pairs.

  Binding 1: operating-points
  ============================

  This binding only supports voltage-frequency pairs.

  Properties:
  - operating-points: An array of 2-tuples items, and each item consists
    of frequency and voltage like <freq-kHz vol-uV>.
  	freq: clock frequency in kHz
  	vol: voltage in microvolt
