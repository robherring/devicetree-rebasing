description: |+
  The Freescale Management Complex (fsl-mc) is a hardware resource
  manager that manages specialized hardware objects used in
  network-oriented packet processing applications. After the fsl-mc
  block is enabled, pools of hardware resources are available, such as
  queues, buffer pools, I/O interfaces. These resources are building
  blocks that can be used to create functional hardware objects/devices
  such as network interfaces, crypto accelerator instances, L2 switches,
  etc.

  * Freescale Management Complex

  The Freescale Management Complex (fsl-mc) is a hardware resource
  manager that manages specialized hardware objects used in
  network-oriented packet processing applications. After the fsl-mc
  block is enabled, pools of hardware resources are available, such as
  queues, buffer pools, I/O interfaces. These resources are building

  such as network interfaces, crypto accelerator instances, L2 switches,
  etc.

  Required properties:

      - compatible
          Value type: <string>
          Definition: Must be "fsl,qoriq-mc".  A Freescale Management Complex
                      compatible with this binding must have Block Revision
                      Registers BRR1 and BRR2 at offset 0x0BF8 and 0x0BFC in
                      the MC control register region.

      - reg
          Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
          Definition: A standard property.  Specifies one or two regions
                      defining the MC's registers:

                         -the first region is the command portal for the
                          this machine and must always be present

                         -the second region is the MC control registers. This
                          region may not be present in some scenarios, such
                          as in the device tree presented to a virtual machine.

      - msi-parent
          Value type: <phandle>
          Definition: Must be present and point to the MSI controller node
                      handling message interrupts for the MC.

      - ranges
          Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
          Definition: A standard property.  Defines the mapping between the child
                      MC address space and the parent system address space.

                      The MC address space is defined by 3 components:
                         <region type> <offset hi> <offset lo>

                      Valid values for region type are
                         0x0 - MC portals
                         0x1 - QBMAN portals

      - #address-cells
          Value type: <u32>
          Definition: Must be 3.  (see definition in 'ranges' property)

      - #size-cells
          Value type: <u32>
          Definition: Must be 1.

  Sub-nodes:

          The fsl-mc node may optionally have dpmac sub-nodes that describe
          the relationship between the Ethernet MACs which belong to the MC
          and the Ethernet PHYs on the system board.

          The dpmac nodes must be under a node named "dpmacs" which contains
          the following properties:

              - #address-cells
                Value type: <u32>
                Definition: Must be present if dpmac sub-nodes are defined and must
                            have a value of 1.

              - #size-cells
                Value type: <u32>
                Definition: Must be present if dpmac sub-nodes are defined and must
                            have a value of 0.

          These nodes must have the following properties:

              - compatible
                Value type: <string>
                Definition: Must be "fsl,qoriq-mc-dpmac".

              - reg
                Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
                Definition: Specifies the id of the dpmac.

              - phy-handle
                Value type: <phandle>
                Definition: Specifies the phandle to the PHY device node associated
                            with the this dpmac.
