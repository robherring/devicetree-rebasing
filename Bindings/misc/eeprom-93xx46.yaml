  EEPROMs (SPI) compatible with Microchip Technology 93xx46 family.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be one of:
      "atmel,at93c46d"
      "eeprom-93xx46"
  - data-size : number of data bits per word (either 8 or 16)

  Optional properties:
  - read-only : parameter-less property which disables writes to the EEPROM
  - select-gpios : if present, specifies the GPIO that will be asserted prior to
    each access to the EEPROM (e.g. for SPI bus multiplexing)

  Property rules described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
  apply.  In particular, "reg" and "spi-max-frequency" properties must be given.
