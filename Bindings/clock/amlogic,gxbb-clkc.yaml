    Example: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
      controller:

    uart_AO: serial@c81004c0 {
      compatible = "amlogic,meson-uart";
      reg = <0xc81004c0 0x14>;
      interrupts = <0 90 1>;
      clocks = <&clkc CLKID_CLK81>;
    };

  * Amlogic GXBB Clock and Reset Unit

  The Amlogic GXBB clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
  controllers within the SoC.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be:
  		"amlogic,gxbb-clkc" for GXBB SoC,
  		"amlogic,gxl-clkc" for GXL and GXM SoC,
  		"amlogic,axg-clkc" for AXG SoC.

  - reg: physical base address of the clock controller and length of memory
         mapped region.

  - #clock-cells: should be 1.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
  preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/gxbb-clkc.h header and can be
  used in device tree sources.
