  * Renesas R-Car Gen2 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the R-Car Gen2 SoCs. It includes three PLLs
  and several fixed ratio dividers.
  The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
  CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be one of
      - "renesas,r8a7790-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7790 CPG
      - "renesas,r8a7791-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7791 CPG
      - "renesas,r8a7792-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7792 CPG
      - "renesas,r8a7793-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7793 CPG
      - "renesas,r8a7794-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7794 CPG
      and "renesas,rcar-gen2-cpg-clocks" as a fallback.

    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG

    - clocks: References to the parent clocks: first to the EXTAL clock, second
      to the USB_EXTAL clock
    - #clock-cells: Must be 1
    - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are "main",
      "pll0", "pll1", "pll3", "lb", "qspi", "sdh", "sd0", "sd1", "z", "rcan", and
      "adsp"
    - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0

  SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be power-managed
  through an MSTP clock should refer to the CPG device node in their
  "power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM domain bindings in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.
