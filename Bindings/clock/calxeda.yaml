  Device Tree Clock bindings for Calxeda highbank platform

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

  [1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be one of the following:
  	"calxeda,hb-pll-clock" - for a PLL clock
  	"calxeda,hb-a9periph-clock" - The A9 peripheral clock divided from the
  		A9 clock.
  	"calxeda,hb-a9bus-clock" - The A9 bus clock divided from the A9 clock.
  	"calxeda,hb-emmc-clock" - Divided clock for MMC/SD controller.
  - reg : shall be the control register offset from SYSREGs base for the clock.
  - clocks : shall be the input parent clock phandle for the clock. This is
  	either an oscillator or a pll output.
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
