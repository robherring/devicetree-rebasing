  This is a part of device tree bindings of MAX77686/MAX77802/MAX77620
  multi-function device. More information can be found in MFD DT binding
  doc as follows:
  	bindings/mfd/max77686.txt for MAX77686 and
  	bindings/mfd/max77802.txt for MAX77802 and
  	bindings/mfd/max77620.txt for MAX77620.

  The MAX77686 contains three 32.768khz clock outputs that can be controlled
  (gated/ungated) over I2C. Clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
  dt-bindings/clock/maxim,max77686.h.


  The MAX77802 contains two 32.768khz clock outputs that can be controlled
  (gated/ungated) over I2C. Clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
  dt-bindings/clock/maxim,max77802.h.

  dt-bindings/clock/maxim,max77620.h.

  Following properties should be presend in main device node of the MFD chip.

  Required properties:

  - #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-output-names: From common clock binding.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume. Following indices are allowed:
      - 0: 32khz_ap clock (max77686, max77802), 32khz_out0 (max77620)
      - 1: 32khz_cp clock (max77686, max77802),
      - 2: 32khz_pmic clock (max77686).

  Clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in above dt-binding header for
  respective chips.
