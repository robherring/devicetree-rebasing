  * Renesas R8A73A4 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the R8A73A4 SoC. It includes five PLLs
  and several fixed ratio dividers.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be "renesas,r8a73a4-cpg-clocks"

    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG

    - clocks: Reference to the parent clocks ("extal1" and "extal2")

    - #clock-cells: Must be 1

    - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are "main",
      "pll0", "pll1", "pll2", "pll2s", "pll2h", "z", "z2", "i", "m3", "b",
      "m1", "m2", "zx", "zs", and "hp".
