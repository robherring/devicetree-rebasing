  * Renesas R8A7740  Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the R8A7740 SoC. It includes three PLLs
  and several fixed ratio and variable ratio dividers.

  * Renesas R8A7740  Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the R8A7740 SoC. It includes three PLLs
  and several fixed ratio and variable ratio dividers.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be "renesas,r8a7740-cpg-clocks"

    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG

    - clocks: Reference to the three parent clocks
    - #clock-cells: Must be 1
    - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are
      "system", "pllc0", "pllc1", "pllc2", "r", "usb24s", "i", "zg", "b",
      "m1", "hp", "hpp", "usbp", "s", "zb", "m3", and "cp".

    - renesas,mode: board-specific settings of the MD_CK* bits
