title: Broadcom BCM2835 auxiliary peripheral support

description: |+
  This binding uses the common clock binding:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  The auxiliary peripherals (UART, SPI1, and SPI2) have a small register
  area controlling clock gating to the peripherals, and providing an IRQ
  status register.

  compatible: {}

    clocks: cprman@7e101000 {
      compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-cprman";
      #clock-cells = <1>;

  Broadcom BCM2835 auxiliary peripheral support

  This binding uses the common clock binding:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  The auxiliary peripherals (UART, SPI1, and SPI2) have a small register
  area controlling clock gating to the peripherals, and providing an IRQ
  status register.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:	Should be "brcm,bcm2835-aux"
  - #clock-cells:	Should be <1>. The permitted clock-specifier values can be
  		  found in include/dt-bindings/clock/bcm2835-aux.h
  - reg:		Specifies base physical address and size of the registers
  - clocks:	The parent clock phandle
