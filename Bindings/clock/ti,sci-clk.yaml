  All clocks on Texas Instruments' SoCs that contain a System Controller,
  are only controlled by this entity. Communication between a host processor
  running an OS and the System Controller happens through a protocol known
  as TI-SCI[1]. This clock implementation plugs into the common clock
  framework and makes use of the TI-SCI protocol on clock API requests.

  Texas Instruments TI-SCI Clocks
  ===============================

  Required properties:
  -------------------
  - compatible: Must be "ti,k2g-sci-clk"
  - #clock-cells: Shall be 2.
    In clock consumers, this cell represents the device ID and clock ID
    exposed by the PM firmware. The list of valid values for the device IDs
    and clocks IDs for 66AK2G SoC are documented at
