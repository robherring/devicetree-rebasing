description: |+
  Marvell Armada 37xx SoCs allow to determine the xtal clock frequencies by
  reading the gpio latch register.

  This node must be a subnode of the node exposing the register address
  of the GPIO block where the gpio latch is located.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be one of the following:
  	"marvell,armada-3700-xtal-clock"
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0

  Optional properties:
  - clock-output-names : from common clock binding; allows overwrite default clock
  	output names ("xtal")
