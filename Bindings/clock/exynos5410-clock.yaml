       controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
       about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

  * Samsung Exynos5410 Clock Controller

  The Exynos5410 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
  controllers within the Exynos5410 SoC.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be "samsung,exynos5410-clock"

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.

  - #clock-cells: should be 1.

  - clocks: should contain an entry specifying the root clock from external
    oscillator supplied through XXTI or XusbXTI pin.  This clock should be
    defined using standard clock bindings with "fin_pll" clock-output-name.
    That clock is being passed internally to the 9 PLLs.

  All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
  dt-bindings/clock/exynos5410.h header and can be used in device
  tree sources.
