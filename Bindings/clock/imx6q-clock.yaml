  * Clock bindings for Freescale i.MX6 Quad

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "fsl,imx6q-ccm"
  - reg: Address and length of the register set
  - interrupts: Should contain CCM interrupt
  - #clock-cells: Should be <1>

  The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
