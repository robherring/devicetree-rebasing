  * Marvell PXA168 Clock Controller

  The PXA168 clock subsystem generates and supplies clock to various
  controllers within the PXA168 SoC.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following.
    - "marvell,pxa168-clock" - controller compatible with PXA168 SoC.

  - reg: physical base address of the clock subsystem and length of memory mapped
    region. There are 3 places in SOC has clock control logic:
    "mpmu", "apmu", "apbc". So three reg spaces need to be defined.

  - #clock-cells: should be 1.
  - #reset-cells: should be 1.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume.

  All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/marvell,pxa168.h>.
