title: NXP LPC1850 Clock Generation Unit (CGU)

maintainers:

description: |+
  The CGU generates multiple independent clocks for the core and the
  peripheral blocks of the LPC18xx. Each independent clock is called
  a base clock and itself is one of the inputs to the two Clock
  Control Units (CCUs) which control the branch clocks to the
  individual peripherals.

  The CGU selects the inputs to the clock generators from multiple
  clock sources, controls the clock generation, and routes the outputs
  of the clock generators through the clock source bus to the output
  stages. Each output stage provides an independent clock source and
  corresponds to one of the base clocks for the LPC18xx.

  This binding uses the common clock binding:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible:
  	Should be "nxp,lpc1850-cgu"
  - reg:
  	Shall define the base and range of the address space
  	containing clock control registers
  - #clock-cells:
  	Shall have value <1>.  The permitted clock-specifier values
  	are the base clock numbers defined below.
  - clocks:
  	Shall contain a list of phandles for the external input
  	sources to the CGU. The list shall be in the following
  	order: xtal, 32khz, enet_rx_clk, enet_tx_clk, gp_clkin.
  - clock-indices:
  	Shall be an ordered list of numbers defining the base clock
  	number provided by the CGU.
  - clock-output-names:
  	Shall be an ordered list of strings defining the names of
  	the clocks provided by the CGU.

  Which base clocks that are available on the CGU depends on the
  specific LPC part. Base clocks are numbered from 0 to 27.
