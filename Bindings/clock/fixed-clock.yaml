  Binding for simple fixed-rate clock sources.

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

  [1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be "fixed-clock".
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
  - clock-frequency : frequency of clock in Hz. Should be a single cell.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-accuracy : accuracy of clock in ppb (parts per billion).
  		   Should be a single cell.
  - clock-output-names : From common clock binding.
