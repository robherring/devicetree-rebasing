description: |+
  Marvell Armada 37xx SoCs provde Time Base Generator clocks which are
  used as parent clocks for the peripheral clocks.

  The TBG clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the
  clock ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.

  The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada 3700:
   0 = TBG A P
   1 = TBG B P
   2 = TBG A S
   3 = TBG B S
