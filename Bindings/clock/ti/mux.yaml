title: Binding for TI mux clock.

  Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1].  It assumes a
  register-mapped multiplexer with multiple input clock signals or
  parents, one of which can be selected as output.  This clock does not
  gate or adjust the parent rate via a divider or multiplier.

  By default the "clocks" property lists the parents in the same order
  as they are programmed into the regster.  E.g:

  	clocks = <&foo_clock>, <&bar_clock>, <&baz_clock>;

  results in programming the register as follows:

  register value		selected parent clock
  0			foo_clock
  1			bar_clock
  2			baz_clock

  Some clock controller IPs do not allow a value of zero to be programmed
  into the register, instead indexing begins at 1.  The optional property
  "index-starts-at-one" modified the scheme as follows:

  register value		selected clock parent
  1			foo_clock
  2			bar_clock
  3			baz_clock

  The binding must provide the register to control the mux. Optionally
  the number of bits to shift the control field in the register can be
  supplied. If the shift value is missing it is the same as supplying
  a zero shift.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be "ti,mux-clock" or "ti,composite-mux-clock".
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
  - clocks : link phandles of parent clocks
  - reg : register offset for register controlling adjustable mux

  Optional properties:
  - ti,bit-shift : number of bits to shift the bit-mask, defaults to
    0 if not present
  - ti,index-starts-at-one : valid input select programming starts at 1, not
    zero
  - ti,set-rate-parent : clk_set_rate is propagated to parent clock,
    not supported by the composite-mux-clock subtype
