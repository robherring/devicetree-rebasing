title: Binding for Texas Instruments clockdomain.

description: |+
  Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1] in consumer role.
  Every clock on TI SoC belongs to one clockdomain, but software
  only needs this information for specific clocks which require
  their parent clockdomain to be controlled when the clock is
  enabled/disabled. This binding doesn't define a new clock
  binding type, it is used to group existing clock nodes under
  hardware hierarchy.

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - const: ti,clockdomain
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 1
    additionalItems: false
  clocks: {}

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be "ti,clockdomain"
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
  - clocks : link phandles of clocks within this domain
