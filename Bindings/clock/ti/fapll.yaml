title: Binding for Texas Instruments FAPLL clock.

  Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. It assumes a
  register-mapped FAPLL with usually two selectable input clocks
  (reference clock and bypass clock), and one or more child
  syntesizers.

  Binding for Texas Instruments FAPLL clock.

  Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. It assumes a
  register-mapped FAPLL with usually two selectable input clocks
  (reference clock and bypass clock), and one or more child
  syntesizers.

  [1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be "ti,dm816-fapll-clock"
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
  - clocks : link phandles of parent clocks (clk-ref and clk-bypass)
  - reg : address and length of the register set for controlling the FAPLL.
