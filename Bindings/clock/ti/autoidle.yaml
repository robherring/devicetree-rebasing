title: Binding for Texas Instruments autoidle clock.

  Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. It assumes a register mapped
  clock which can be put to idle automatically by hardware based on the usage
  and a configuration bit setting. Autoidle clock is never an individual
  clock, it is always a derivative of some basic clock like a gate, divider,
  or fixed-factor.

  Required properties:
  - reg : offset for the register controlling the autoidle
  - ti,autoidle-shift : bit shift of the autoidle enable bit
  - ti,invert-autoidle-bit : autoidle is enabled by setting the bit to 0
