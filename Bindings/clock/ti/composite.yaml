title: Binding for TI composite clock.

  Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. It assumes a
  register-mapped composite clock with multiple different sub-types;

  a multiplexer clock with multiple input clock signals or parents, one
  of which can be selected as output, this behaves exactly as [2]

  an adjustable clock rate divider, this behaves exactly as [3]

  a gating function which can be used to enable and disable the output
  clock, this behaves exactly as [4]

  The binding must provide a list of the component clocks that shall be
  merged to this clock. The component clocks shall be of one of the
  "ti,*composite*-clock" types.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be: "ti,composite-clock"
  - clocks : link phandles of component clocks
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
