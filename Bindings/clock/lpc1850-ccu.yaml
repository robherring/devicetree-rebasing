  * NXP LPC1850 Clock Control Unit (CCU)

  Each CGU base clock has several clock branches which can be turned on
  or off independently by the Clock Control Units CCU1 or CCU2. The
  branch clocks are distributed between CCU1 and CCU2.

   - Above text taken from NXP LPC1850 User Manual.

  This binding uses the common clock binding:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible:
  	Should be "nxp,lpc1850-ccu"
  - reg:
  	Shall define the base and range of the address space
  	containing clock control registers
  - #clock-cells:
  	Shall have value <1>.  The permitted clock-specifier values
  	are the branch clock names defined in table below.
  - clocks:
  	Shall contain a list of phandles for the base clocks routed
  	from the CGU to the specific CCU. See mapping of base clocks
  	and CCU in table below.
  - clock-names:
  	Shall contain a list of names for the base clock routed
  	from the CGU to the specific CCU. Valid CCU clock names:
  	"base_usb0_clk",  "base_periph_clk", "base_usb1_clk",
  	"base_cpu_clk",   "base_spifi_clk",  "base_spi_clk",
  	"base_apb1_clk",  "base_apb3_clk",   "base_adchs_clk",
  	"base_sdio_clk",  "base_ssp0_clk",   "base_ssp1_clk",
  	"base_uart0_clk", "base_uart1_clk",  "base_uart2_clk",
  	"base_uart3_clk", "base_audio_clk"

  Which branch clocks that are available on the CCU depends on the
  specific LPC part. Check the user manual for your specific part.

  A list of CCU clocks can be found in dt-bindings/clock/lpc18xx-ccu.h.
