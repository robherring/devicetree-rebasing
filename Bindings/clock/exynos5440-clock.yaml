  * Samsung Exynos5440 Clock Controller

  The Exynos5440 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
  controllers within the Exynos5440 SoC.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be "samsung,exynos5440-clock".

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.

  - #clock-cells: should be 1.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume.

  All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
  dt-bindings/clock/exynos5440.h header and can be used in device
  tree sources.
