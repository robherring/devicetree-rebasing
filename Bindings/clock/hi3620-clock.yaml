  * Hisilicon Hi3620 Clock Controller

  The Hi3620 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
  controllers within the Hi3620 SoC.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following.
    - "hisilicon,hi3620-clock" - controller compatible with Hi3620 SoC.
    - "hisilicon,hi3620-mmc-clock" - controller specific for Hi3620 mmc.

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.

  - #clock-cells: should be 1.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume.

  All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hi3620-clock.h>.
