  Ingenic SoC CGU binding

  The CGU in an Ingenic SoC provides all the clocks generated on-chip. It
  typically includes a variety of PLLs, multiplexers, dividers & gates in order
  to provide many different clock signals derived from only 2 external source
  clocks.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "ingenic,<soctype>-cgu".
    For example "ingenic,jz4740-cgu" or "ingenic,jz4780-cgu".
  - reg : The address & length of the CGU registers.
  - clocks : List of phandle & clock specifiers for clocks external to the CGU.
    Two such external clocks should be specified - first the external crystal
    "ext" and second the RTC clock source "rtc".
  - clock-names : List of name strings for the external clocks.
  - #clock-cells: Should be 1.
    Clock consumers specify this argument to identify a clock. The valid values
    may be found in <dt-bindings/clock/<soctype>-cgu.h>.
