  * Sigma Designs Tango4 Clock Generator

  The Tango4 clock generator outputs cpu_clk and sys_clk (the latter is used
  for RAM and various peripheral devices). The clock binding described here
  is applicable to all Tango4 SoCs.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be "sigma,tango4-clkgen".
  - reg: physical base address of the device and length of memory mapped region.
  - clocks: phandle of the input clock (crystal oscillator).
  - clock-output-names: should be "cpuclk" and "sysclk".
  - #clock-cells: should be set to 1.
