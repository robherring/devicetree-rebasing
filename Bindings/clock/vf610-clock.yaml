  * Clock bindings for Freescale Vybrid VF610 SOC

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "fsl,vf610-ccm"
  - reg: Address and length of the register set
  - #clock-cells: Should be <1>

  Optional properties:
  - clocks: list of clock identifiers which are external input clocks to the
  	given clock controller. Please refer the next section to find
  	the input clocks for a given controller.
  - clock-names: list of names of clocks which are exteral input clocks to the
  	given clock controller.

  Input clocks for top clock controller:
  	- sxosc (external crystal oscillator 32KHz, recommended)
  	- fxosc (external crystal oscillator 24MHz, recommended)
  	- audio_ext
  	- enet_ext

  The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
  ID in its "clocks" phandle cell. See include/dt-bindings/clock/vf610-clock.h
  for the full list of VF610 clock IDs.
