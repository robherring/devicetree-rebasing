  The CPG generates core clocks for the R8A7778. It includes two PLLs and
  several fixed ratio dividers.
  The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
  CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.

  * Renesas R8A7778 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the R8A7778. It includes two PLLs and
  several fixed ratio dividers.
  The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
  CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be "renesas,r8a7778-cpg-clocks"
    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG
    - #clock-cells: Must be 1
    - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are
      "plla", "pllb", "b", "out", "p", "s", and "s1".
    - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0

  SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be power-managed
  through an MSTP clock should refer to the CPG device node in their
  "power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM domain bindings in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.
