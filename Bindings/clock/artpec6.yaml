title: Clock bindings for Axis ARTPEC-6 chip

maintainers:
  - Lars Persson <lars.persson@axis.com>
description: |+
  The bindings are based on the clock provider binding in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  External clocks:
  ----------------

  There are two external inputs to the main clock controller which should be
  provided using the common clock bindings.
  - "sys_refclk": External 50 Mhz oscillator (required)
  - "i2s_refclk": Alternate audio reference clock (optional).

  Main clock controller
  ---------------------

  Required properties:
  - #clock-cells: Should be <1>
    See dt-bindings/clock/axis,artpec6-clkctrl.h for the list of valid identifiers.
  - compatible: Should be "axis,artpec6-clkctrl"
  - reg: Must contain the base address and length of the system controller
  - clocks:  Must contain a phandle entry for each clock in clock-names
  - clock-names: Must include the external oscillator ("sys_refclk"). Optional
    ones are the audio reference clock ("i2s_refclk") and the audio fractional
    dividers ("frac_clk0" and "frac_clk1").
