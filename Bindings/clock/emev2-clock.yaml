  Device tree Clock bindings for Renesas EMMA Mobile EV2

  This binding uses the common clock binding.

  * SMU
  System Management Unit described in user's manual R19UH0037EJ1000_SMU.
  This is not a clock provider, but clocks under SMU depend on it.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "renesas,emev2-smu"
  - reg: Address and Size of SMU registers

  * SMU_CLKDIV
  Function block with an input mux and a divider, which corresponds to
  "Serial clock generator" in fig."Clock System Overview" of the manual,
  and "xxx frequency division setting register" (XXXCLKDIV) registers.
  This makes internal (neither input nor output) clock that is provided
  to input of xxxGCLK block.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "renesas,emev2-smu-clkdiv"
  - reg: Byte offset from SMU base and Bit position in the register
  - clocks: Parent clocks. Input clocks as described in clock-bindings.txt
  - #clock-cells: Should be <0>

  * SMU_GCLK
  Clock gating node shown as "Clock stop processing block" in the
  fig."Clock System Overview" of the manual.
  Registers are "xxx clock gate control register" (XXXGCLKCTRL).

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "renesas,emev2-smu-gclk"
  - reg: Byte offset from SMU base and Bit position in the register
  - clocks: Input clock as described in clock-bindings.txt
  - #clock-cells: Should be <0>
