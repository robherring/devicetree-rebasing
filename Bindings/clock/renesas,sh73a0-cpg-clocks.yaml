  * Renesas SH73A0 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the SH73A0 SoC. It includes four PLLs
  and several fixed ratio dividers.

  * Renesas SH73A0 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the SH73A0 SoC. It includes four PLLs
  and several fixed ratio dividers.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be "renesas,sh73a0-cpg-clocks"

    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG

    - clocks: Reference to the parent clocks ("extal1" and "extal2")

    - #clock-cells: Must be 1

    - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are "main",
      "pll0", "pll1", "pll2", "pll3", "dsi0phy", "dsi1phy", "zg", "m3", "b",
      "m1", "m2", "z", "zx", and "hp".
