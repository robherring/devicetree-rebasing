title: NVIDIA Tegra20 Clock And Reset Controller

maintainers:

description: |
  This binding uses the common clock binding:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  The CAR (Clock And Reset) Controller on Tegra is the HW module responsible
  for muxing and gating Tegra's clocks, and setting their rates.

  Required properties :
  - compatible : Should be "nvidia,tegra20-car"
  - reg : Should contain CAR registers location and length
  - clocks : Should contain phandle and clock specifiers for two clocks:
    the 32 KHz "32k_in", and the board-specific oscillator "osc".
  - #clock-cells : Should be 1.
    In clock consumers, this cell represents the clock ID exposed by the
    CAR. The assignments may be found in header file
    <dt-bindings/clock/tegra20-car.h>.
  - #reset-cells : Should be 1.
    In clock consumers, this cell represents the bit number in the CAR's
    array of CLK_RST_CONTROLLER_RST_DEVICES_* registers.

  Example SoC include file:

  / {
  	tegra_car: clock {
  		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-car";
  		reg = <0x60006000 0x1000>;
  		#clock-cells = <1>;
  		#reset-cells = <1>;
  	};

  	usb@c5004000 {
  		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_USB2>;
  	};
  };

  Example board file:

  / {
  	clocks {
  		compatible = "simple-bus";
  		#address-cells = <1>;
  		#size-cells = <0>;

  		osc: clock@0 {
  			compatible = "fixed-clock";
  			reg = <0>;
  			#clock-cells = <0>;
  			clock-frequency = <12000000>;
  		};

  		clk_32k: clock@1 {
  			compatible = "fixed-clock";
  			reg = <1>;
  			#clock-cells = <0>;
  			clock-frequency = <32768>;
  		};
  	};

  	&tegra_car {
  		clocks = <&clk_32k> <&osc>;
  	};
  };
