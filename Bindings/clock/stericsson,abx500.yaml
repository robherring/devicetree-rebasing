title: Clock bindings for ST-Ericsson ABx500 clocks

description: |
  Required properties :
  - compatible : shall contain the following:
    "stericsson,ab8500-clk"
  - #clock-cells should be <1>

  The ABx500 clocks need to be placed as a subnode of an AB8500
  device node, see mfd/ab8500.txt

  All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
  dt-bindings/clock/ste-ab8500.h header and can be used in device
  tree sources.

  Example:

  clock-controller {
  	compatible = "stericsson,ab8500-clk";
  	#clock-cells = <1>;
  };
