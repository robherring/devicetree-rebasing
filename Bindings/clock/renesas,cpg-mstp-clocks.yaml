  * Renesas CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks

  The CPG can gate SoC device clocks. The gates are organized in groups of up to
  32 gates.

  This device tree binding describes a single 32 gate clocks group per node.
  Clocks are referenced by user nodes by the MSTP node phandle and the clock
  index in the group, from 0 to 31.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be one of the following
      - "renesas,r7s72100-mstp-clocks" for R7S72100 (RZ) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a73a4-mstp-clocks" for R8A73A4 (R-Mobile APE6) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7740-mstp-clocks" for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7778-mstp-clocks" for R8A7778 (R-Car M1) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7779-mstp-clocks" for R8A7779 (R-Car H1) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7790-mstp-clocks" for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7791-mstp-clocks" for R8A7791 (R-Car M2-W) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7792-mstp-clocks" for R8A7792 (R-Car V2H) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7793-mstp-clocks" for R8A7793 (R-Car M2-N) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,r8a7794-mstp-clocks" for R8A7794 (R-Car E2) MSTP gate clocks
      - "renesas,sh73a0-mstp-clocks" for SH73A0 (SH-MobileAG5) MSTP gate clocks
      and "renesas,cpg-mstp-clocks" as a fallback.
    - reg: Base address and length of the I/O mapped registers used by the MSTP
      clocks. The first register is the clock control register and is mandatory.
      The second register is the clock status register and is optional when not
      implemented in hardware.
    - clocks: Reference to the parent clocks, one per output clock. The parents
      must appear in the same order as the output clocks.
    - #clock-cells: Must be 1
    - clock-output-names: The name of the clocks as free-form strings
    - clock-indices: Indices of the gate clocks into the group (0 to 31)

  The clocks, clock-output-names and clock-indices properties contain one entry
  per gate clock. The MSTP groups are sparsely populated. Unimplemented gate
  clocks must not be declared.
