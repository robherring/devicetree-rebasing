  * Renesas RZ/A1 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

  The CPG generates core clocks for the RZ/A1 SoCs. It includes the PLL, variable
  CPU and GPU clocks, and several fixed ratio dividers.
  The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
  CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be one of
      - "renesas,r7s72100-cpg-clocks" for the r7s72100 CPG
      and "renesas,rz-cpg-clocks" as a fallback.
    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG
    - clocks: References to possible parent clocks. Order must match clock modes
      in the datasheet. For the r7s72100, this is extal, usb_x1.
    - #clock-cells: Must be 1
    - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are "pll",
      "i", and "g"
    - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0

  SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be power-managed
  through an MSTP clock should refer to the CPG device node in their
  "power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM domain bindings in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.
