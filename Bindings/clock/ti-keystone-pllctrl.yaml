  The main pll controller used to drive theC66x CorePacs, the switch fabric,
  and a majority of the peripheral clocks (all but the ARM CorePacs, DDR3 and
  the NETCP modules) requires a PLL Controller to manage the various clock
  divisions, gating, and synchronization.

  * Device tree bindings for Texas Instruments keystone pll controller

  The main pll controller used to drive theC66x CorePacs, the switch fabric,
  and a majority of the peripheral clocks (all but the ARM CorePacs, DDR3 and
  the NETCP modules) requires a PLL Controller to manage the various clock
  divisions, gating, and synchronization.

  Required properties:

  - compatible:		"ti,keystone-pllctrl", "syscon"

  - reg:			contains offset/length value for pll controller
  			registers space.
