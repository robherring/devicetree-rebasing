title: Peripheral Clock bindings for Marvell Armada 37xx SoCs

description: |+
  Marvell Armada 37xx SoCs provide peripheral clocks which are
  used as clock source for the peripheral of the SoC.

  There are two different blocks associated to north bridge and south
  bridge.

  The peripheral clock consumer should specify the desired clock by
  having the clock ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.

  The following is a list of provided IDs for Armada 370 North bridge clocks:
  ID	Clock name	Description
  -----------------------------------
  0	mmc		MMC controller
  1	sata_host	Sata Host
  2	sec_at		Security AT
  3	sac_dap		Security DAP
  4	tsecm		Security Engine

    north bridge block, or
    "marvell,armada-3700-periph-clock-sb" for the south bridge block
  - reg : must be the register address of North/South Bridge Clock register
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1

  - clocks : list of the parent clock phandle in the following order:
    TBG-A P, TBG-B P, TBG-A S, TBG-B S and finally the xtal clock.
