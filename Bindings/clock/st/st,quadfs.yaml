  This version contains a programmable PLL which can generate up to 216, 432
  or 660MHz (from a 30MHz oscillator input) as the input to the digital
  synthesizers.

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

  Binding for a type of quad channel digital frequency synthesizer found on
  certain STMicroelectronics consumer electronics SoC devices.

  This version contains a programmable PLL which can generate up to 216, 432
  or 660MHz (from a 30MHz oscillator input) as the input to the digital
  synthesizers.

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

  [1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be:
    "st,quadfs"
    "st,quadfs-pll"


  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1.

  - reg : A Base address and length of the register set.

  - clocks : from common clock binding

  - clock-output-names : From common clock binding. The block has 4
                         clock outputs but not all of them in a specific instance
                         have to be used in the SoC. If a clock name is left as
                         an empty string then no clock will be created for the
                         output associated with that string index. If fewer than
                         4 strings are provided then no clocks will be created
                         for the remaining outputs.
