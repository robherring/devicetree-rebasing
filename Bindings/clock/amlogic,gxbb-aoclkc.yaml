  * Amlogic GXBB AO Clock and Reset Unit

  The Amlogic GXBB AO clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
  controllers within the Always-On part of the SoC.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: value should be different for each SoC family as :
  	- GXBB (S905) : "amlogic,meson-gxbb-aoclkc"
  	- GXL (S905X, S905D) : "amlogic,meson-gxl-aoclkc"
  	- GXM (S912) : "amlogic,meson-gxm-aoclkc"
  	followed by the common "amlogic,meson-gx-aoclkc"

  - #clock-cells: should be 1.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
  preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/gxbb-aoclkc.h header and can be
  used in device tree sources.

  - #reset-cells: should be 1.

  Each reset is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
  to specify the reset which they consume. All available resets are defined as
  preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/reset/gxbb-aoclkc.h header and can be
  used in device tree sources.

  Parent node should have the following properties :
  - compatible: "amlogic,meson-gx-ao-sysctrl", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
  - reg: base address and size of the AO system control register space.
