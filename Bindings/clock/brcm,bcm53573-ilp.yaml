description: |+
  This binding uses the common clock binding:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  This binding is used for ILP clock (sometimes referred as "slow clock")
  on Broadcom BCM53573 devices using Cortex-A7 CPU.

  ILP's rate has to be calculated on runtime and it depends on ALP clock
  which has to be referenced.

  This clock is part of PMU (Power Management Unit), a Broadcom's device
  handing power-related aspects. Its node must be sub-node of the PMU
  device.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "brcm,bcm53573-ilp"
  - clocks: has to reference an ALP clock
  - #clock-cells: should be <0>
  - clock-output-names: from common clock bindings, should contain clock
