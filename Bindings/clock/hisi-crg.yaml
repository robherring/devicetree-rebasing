  * HiSilicon Clock and Reset Generator(CRG)

  The CRG module provides clock and reset signals to various
  modules within the SoC.

  This binding uses the following bindings:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt

  Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following.
    - "hisilicon,hi3516cv300-crg"
    - "hisilicon,hi3516cv300-sysctrl"
    - "hisilicon,hi3519-crg"
    - "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-crg"
    - "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-sysctrl"

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.

  - #clock-cells: should be 1.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume.

  All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hi3519-clock.h>.

  - #reset-cells: should be 2.

  A reset signal can be controlled by writing a bit register in the CRG module.
  The reset specifier consists of two cells. The first cell represents the
  register offset relative to the base address. The second cell represents the
  bit index in the register.
