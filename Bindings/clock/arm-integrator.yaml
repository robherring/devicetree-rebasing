  Auxiliary Oscillator Clock

  This is a configurable clock fed from a 24 MHz chrystal,
  used for generating e.g. video clocks. It is located on the
  core module and there is only one of these.

  This clock node *must* be a subnode of the core module, since
  it obtains the base address for it's address range from its
  parent node.
