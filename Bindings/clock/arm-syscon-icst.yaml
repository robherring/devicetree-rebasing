  The ICS525 and ICS307 oscillators are produced by Integrated Devices
  Technology (IDT). ARM integrated these oscillators deeply into their
  reference designs by adding special control registers that manage such
  oscillators to their system controllers.

  The various ARM system controllers contain logic to serialize and initialize
  an ICST clock request after a write to the 32 bit register at an offset
  into the system controller. Furthermore, to even be able to alter one of
  these frequencies, the system controller must first be unlocked by
  writing a special token to another offset in the system controller.

  Some ARM hardware contain special versions of the serial interface that only
  connects the low 8 bits of the VDW (missing one bit), hardwires RDW to
  different values and sometimes also hardwire the output divider. They
  therefore have special compatible strings as per this table (the OD value is
  the value on the pins, not the resulting output divider):

  The ICST oscillator must be provided inside a system controller node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must be one of
    "arm,syscon-icst525"
    "arm,syscon-icst307"
    "arm,syscon-icst525-integratorap-cm"
    "arm,syscon-icst525-integratorap-sys"
    "arm,syscon-icst525-integratorap-pci"
    "arm,syscon-icst525-integratorcp-cm-core"
    "arm,syscon-icst525-integratorcp-cm-mem"
  - lock-offset: the offset address into the system controller where the
    unlocking register is located
  - vco-offset: the offset address into the system controller where the
    ICST control register is located (even 32 bit address)
  - #clock-cells: must be <0>
  - clocks: parent clock, since the ICST needs a parent clock to derive its
    frequency from, this attribute is compulsory.
