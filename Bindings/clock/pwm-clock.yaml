  Binding for an external clock signal driven by a PWM pin.

  This binding uses the common clock binding[1] and the common PWM binding[2].

  [2] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be "pwm-clock".
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
  - pwms : from common PWM binding; this determines the clock frequency
    via the period given in the PWM specifier.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-output-names : From common clock binding.
  - clock-frequency : Exact output frequency, in case the PWM period
    is not exact but was rounded to nanoseconds.
