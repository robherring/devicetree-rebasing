description: |
  Required properties :
  - compatible: must contain one of the following compatibles:
  		- "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-de2-clk"
  		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-de2-clk"
  		- "allwinner,sun8i-v3s-de2-clk"
  		- "allwinner,sun50i-h5-de2-clk"

  - reg: Must contain the registers base address and length
  - clocks: phandle to the clocks feeding the display engine subsystem.
  	  Three are needed:
    - "mod": the display engine module clock (on A83T it's the DE PLL)
    - "bus": the bus clock for the whole display engine subsystem
  - clock-names: Must contain the clock names described just above
  - resets: phandle to the reset control for the display engine subsystem.
  - #clock-cells : must contain 1
  - #reset-cells : must contain 1

  Example:
  de2_clocks: clock@1000000 {
  	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-de2-clk";
  	reg = <0x01000000 0x100000>;
  	clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_DE>,
  		 <&ccu CLK_DE>;
  	clock-names = "bus",
  		      "mod";
  	resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_DE>;
  	#clock-cells = <1>;
  	#reset-cells = <1>;
  };
