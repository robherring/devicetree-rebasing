title: PLL divider based Dove clocks

description: |+
  Marvell Dove has a 2GHz PLL, which feeds into a set of dividers to provide
  high speed clocks for a number of peripherals.  These dividers are part of
  the PMU, and thus this node should be a child of the PMU node.

  The following clocks are provided:

  ID	Clock
  -------------
  0	AXI bus clock
  1	GPU clock
  2	VMeta clock
  3	LCD clock

  PLL divider based Dove clocks

  Marvell Dove has a 2GHz PLL, which feeds into a set of dividers to provide
  high speed clocks for a number of peripherals.  These dividers are part of
  the PMU, and thus this node should be a child of the PMU node.

  The following clocks are provided:

  ID	Clock
  -------------
  0	AXI bus clock
  1	GPU clock
  2	VMeta clock
  3	LCD clock

  Required properties:
  - compatible : shall be "marvell,dove-divider-clock"
  - reg : shall be the register address of the Core PLL and Clock Divider
     Control 0 register.  This will cover that register, as well as the
     Core PLL and Clock Divider Control 1 register.  Thus, it will have
     a size of 8.
  - #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1

  divider_clk: core-clock@64 {
  	compatible = "marvell,dove-divider-clock";
  	reg = <0x0064 0x8>;
  	#clock-cells = <1>;
  };
