  NVIDIA Tegra20/Tegra30/Tegr114/Tegra124 fuse block.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : For Tegra20, must contain "nvidia,tegra20-efuse".  For Tegra30,
    must contain "nvidia,tegra30-efuse".  For Tegra114, must contain
    "nvidia,tegra114-efuse".  For Tegra124, must contain "nvidia,tegra124-efuse".
    Otherwise, must contain "nvidia,<chip>-efuse", plus one of the above, where
    <chip> is tegra132.
    Details:
    nvidia,tegra20-efuse: Tegra20 requires using APB DMA to read the fuse data
  	due to a hardware bug. Tegra20 also lacks certain information which is
  	available in later generations such as fab code, lot code, wafer id,..
    nvidia,tegra30-efuse, nvidia,tegra114-efuse and nvidia,tegra124-efuse:
  	The differences between these SoCs are the size of the efuse array,
  	the location of the spare (OEM programmable) bits and the location of
  	the speedo data.
  - reg: Should contain 1 entry: the entry gives the physical address and length
         of the fuse registers.
  - clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: Must include the following entries:
    - fuse
  - resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names: Must include the following entries:
   - fuse
