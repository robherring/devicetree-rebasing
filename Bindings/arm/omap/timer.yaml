  OMAP Timer bindings

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Should be set to one of the below. Please note that
  			OMAP44xx devices have timer instances that are 100%
  			register compatible with OMAP3xxx devices as well as
  			newer timers that are not 100% register compatible.
  			So for OMAP44xx devices timer instances may use
  			different compatible strings.

  			ti,omap2420-timer (applicable to OMAP24xx devices)
  			ti,omap3430-timer (applicable to OMAP3xxx/44xx devices)
  			ti,omap4430-timer (applicable to OMAP44xx devices)
  			ti,omap5430-timer (applicable to OMAP543x devices)
  			ti,am335x-timer	(applicable to AM335x devices)
  			ti,am335x-timer-1ms (applicable to AM335x devices)

  - reg:			Contains timer register address range (base address and
  			length).
  - interrupts: 		Contains the interrupt information for the timer. The
  			format is being dependent on which interrupt controller
  			the OMAP device uses.
  - ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated to the timer, "timer<X>",
  			where <X> is the instance number of the timer from the
  			HW spec.

  Optional properties:
  - ti,timer-alwon:	Indicates the timer is in an alway-on power domain.
  - ti,timer-dsp:		Indicates the timer can interrupt the on-chip DSP in
  			addition to the ARM CPU.
  - ti,timer-pwm: 	Indicates the timer can generate a PWM output.
  - ti,timer-secure: 	Indicates the timer is reserved on a secure OMAP device
  			and therefore cannot be used by the kernel.
