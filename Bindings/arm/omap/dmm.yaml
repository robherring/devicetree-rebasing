title: OMAP Dynamic Memory Manager (DMM) bindings

maintainers:

description: |+
  The dynamic memory manager (DMM) is a module located immediately in front of the
  SDRAM controllers (called EMIFs on OMAP). DMM manages various aspects of memory
  accesses such as priority generation amongst initiators, configuration of SDRAM
  interleaving, optimizing transfer of 2D block objects, and provide MMU-like page
  translation for initiators which need contiguous dma bus addresses.

  OMAP Dynamic Memory Manager (DMM) bindings

  The dynamic memory manager (DMM) is a module located immediately in front of the
  SDRAM controllers (called EMIFs on OMAP). DMM manages various aspects of memory
  accesses such as priority generation amongst initiators, configuration of SDRAM
  interleaving, optimizing transfer of 2D block objects, and provide MMU-like page
  translation for initiators which need contiguous dma bus addresses.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:	Should contain "ti,omap4-dmm" for OMAP4 family
  		Should contain "ti,omap5-dmm" for OMAP5 and DRA7x family
  - reg:		Contains DMM register address range (base address and length)
  - interrupts:	Should contain an interrupt-specifier for DMM_IRQ.
  - ti,hwmods:	Name of the hwmod associated to DMM, which is typically "dmm"
