  OMAP is currently using a static file per SoC family to describe the
  IPs present in the SoC.
  On top of that an omap_device is created to extend the platform_device
  capabilities and to allow binding with one or several hwmods.
  The hwmods will contain all the information to build the device:
  address range, irq lines, dma lines, interconnect, PRCM register,
  clock domain, input clocks.
  For the moment just point to the existing hwmod, the next step will be
  to move data from hwmod to device-tree representation.

  OMAP is currently using a static file per SoC family to describe the
  IPs present in the SoC.
  On top of that an omap_device is created to extend the platform_device
  capabilities and to allow binding with one or several hwmods.
  The hwmods will contain all the information to build the device:
  address range, irq lines, dma lines, interconnect, PRCM register,
  clock domain, input clocks.
  For the moment just point to the existing hwmod, the next step will be
  to move data from hwmod to device-tree representation.


  Required properties:
  - compatible: Every devices present in OMAP SoC should be in the
    form: "ti,XXX"
  - ti,hwmods: list of hwmod names (ascii strings), that comes from the OMAP
    HW documentation, attached to a device. Must contain at least
    one hwmod.

  Optional properties:
  - ti,no_idle_on_suspend: When present, it prevents the PM to idle the module
    during suspend.
  - ti,no-reset-on-init: When present, the module should not be reset at init
  - ti,no-idle-on-init: When present, the module should not be idled at init
  - ti,no-idle: When present, the module is never allowed to idle.
