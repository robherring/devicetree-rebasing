  L4 interconnect bindings

  These bindings describe the OMAP SoCs L4 interconnect bus.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "ti,omap2-l4" for OMAP2 family l4 core bus
  	       Should be "ti,omap2-l4-wkup" for OMAP2 family l4 wkup bus
  	       Should be "ti,omap3-l4-core" for OMAP3 family l4 core bus
  	       Should be "ti,omap4-l4-cfg" for OMAP4 family l4 cfg bus
  	       Should be "ti,omap4-l4-wkup" for OMAP4 family l4 wkup bus
  	       Should be "ti,omap5-l4-cfg" for OMAP5 family l4 cfg bus
  	       Should be "ti,omap5-l4-wkup" for OMAP5 family l4 wkup bus
  	       Should be "ti,dra7-l4-cfg" for DRA7 family l4 cfg bus
  	       Should be "ti,dra7-l4-wkup" for DRA7 family l4 wkup bus
  	       Should be "ti,am3-l4-wkup" for AM33xx family l4 wkup bus
