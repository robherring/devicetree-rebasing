title: QEMU Firmware Configuration bindings for ARM

maintainers:
  - Laszlo Ersek <lersek@redhat.com>
description: |+
  QEMU's arm-softmmu and aarch64-softmmu emulation / virtualization targets
  provide the following Firmware Configuration interface on the "virt" machine
  type:

  - A write-only, 16-bit wide selector (or control) register,
  - a read-write, 64-bit wide data register.

  QEMU exposes the control and data register to ARM guests as memory mapped
  registers; their location is communicated to the guest's UEFI firmware in the
  DTB that QEMU places at the bottom of the guest's DRAM.

  The authoritative guest-side hardware interface documentation to the fw_cfg
  device can be found in "docs/specs/fw_cfg.txt" in the QEMU source tree.

  Required properties:

  - compatible: "qemu,fw-cfg-mmio".

  - reg: the MMIO region used by the device.
    * Bytes 0x0 to 0x7 cover the data register.
    * Bytes 0x8 to 0x9 cover the selector register.
    * Further registers may be appended to the region in case of future interface
      revisions / feature bits.
