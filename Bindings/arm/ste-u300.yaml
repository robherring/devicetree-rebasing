  For various board the "board" node may contain specific properties
  that pertain to this particular board, such as board-specific GPIOs
  or board power regulator supplies.

  Required root node property:

  compatible="stericsson,u300";

  Required node: syscon
  This contains the system controller.
  - compatible: must be "stericsson,u300-syscon".
  - reg: the base address and size of the system controller.

  Boards with the U300 SoC include:

  S365 "Small Board U365":

  Required node: s365
  This contains the board-specific information.
  - compatible: must be "stericsson,s365".
  - vana15-supply: the regulator supplying the 1.5V to drive the
    board.
  - syscon: a pointer to the syscon node so we can access the
    syscon registers to set the board as self-powered.

  Example:

  / {
  	model = "ST-Ericsson U300";
  	compatible = "stericsson,u300";
  	#address-cells = <1>;
  	#size-cells = <1>;

  	s365 {
  		compatible = "stericsson,s365";
  		vana15-supply = <&ab3100_ldo_d_reg>;
  		syscon = <&syscon>;
  	};

  	syscon: syscon@c0011000 {
  		compatible = "stericsson,u300-syscon";
  		reg = <0xc0011000 0x1000>;
  	};
  };
