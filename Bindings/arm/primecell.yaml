  * ARM Primecell Peripherals

  ARM, Ltd. Primecell peripherals have a standard id register that can be used to
  identify the peripheral type, vendor, and revision. This value can be used for
  driver matching.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be a specific name for the peripheral and
                 "arm,primecell".  The specific name will match the ARM
                 engineering name for the logic block in the form: "arm,pl???"

  Optional properties:

  - arm,primecell-periphid : Value to override the h/w value with
  - clocks : From common clock binding. First clock is phandle to clock for apb
  	pclk. Additional clocks are optional and specific to those peripherals.
  - clock-names : From common clock binding. Shall be "apb_pclk" for first clock.
  - dmas : From common DMA binding. If present, refers to one or more dma channels.
  - dma-names : From common DMA binding, needs to match the 'dmas' property.
                Devices with exactly one receive and transmit channel shall name
                these "rx" and "tx", respectively.
  - pinctrl-<n> : Pinctrl states as described in bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
  - pinctrl-names : Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states
  - interrupts : one or more interrupt specifiers
  - interrupt-names : names corresponding to the interrupts properties
