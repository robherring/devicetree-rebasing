description: |+
  The MSCM IP contains multiple sub modules, this binding describes the second
  block of registers which control the interrupt router. The interrupt router
  allows to configure the recipient of each peripheral interrupt. Furthermore
  it controls the directed processor interrupts. The module is available in all
  Vybrid SoC's but is only really useful in dual core configurations (VF6xx
  which comes with a Cortex-A5/Cortex-M4 combination).

  Freescale Vybrid Miscellaneous System Control - Interrupt Router

  The MSCM IP contains multiple sub modules, this binding describes the second
  block of registers which control the interrupt router. The interrupt router
  allows to configure the recipient of each peripheral interrupt. Furthermore
  it controls the directed processor interrupts. The module is available in all
  Vybrid SoC's but is only really useful in dual core configurations (VF6xx
  which comes with a Cortex-A5/Cortex-M4 combination).

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		"fsl,vf610-mscm-ir"
  - reg:			the register range of the MSCM Interrupt Router
  - fsl,cpucfg:		The handle to the MSCM CPU configuration node, required
  			to get the current CPU ID
  - interrupt-controller:	Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells:	Two cells, interrupt number and cells.
  			The hardware interrupt number according to interrupt
  			assignment of the interrupt router is required.
  			Flags get passed only when using GIC as parent. Flags
  			encoding as documented by the GIC bindings.
  - interrupt-parent:	Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller of
  			the CPU the device tree is intended to be used on. This
  			is either the node of the GIC or NVIC controller.
