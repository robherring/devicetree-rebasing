description: |+
  The AP806 is one of the two core HW blocks of the Marvell Armada 7K/8K
  SoCs. It contains a system controller, which provides a number
  registers giving access to numerous features: clocks, pin-muxing and
  many other SoC configuration items. This DT binding allows to describe
  this system controller.

  For the top level node:
   - compatible: must be: "syscon", "simple-mfd";
    - reg: register area of the AP806 system controller

  Clocks:
  -------


  The Device Tree node representing the AP806 system controller provides
  a number of clocks:

   - 0: clock of CPU cluster 0
   - 1: clock of CPU cluster 1
   - 2: fixed PLL at 1200 Mhz
   - 3: MSS clock, derived from the fixed PLL
