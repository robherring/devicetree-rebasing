  Work in progress statement:

  Device tree files and bindings applying to Marvell Berlin SoCs and boards are
  considered "unstable". Any Marvell Berlin device tree binding may change at any
  time. Be sure to use a device tree binary and a kernel image generated from the
  same source tree.

  Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ABI.txt for a definition of a
  stable binding/ABI.

  Marvell Berlin SoC Family Device Tree Bindings
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Work in progress statement:

  Device tree files and bindings applying to Marvell Berlin SoCs and boards are
  considered "unstable". Any Marvell Berlin device tree binding may change at any
  time. Be sure to use a device tree binary and a kernel image generated from the

  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Boards with a SoC of the Marvell Berlin family, e.g. Armada 1500
  shall have the following properties:

  * Required root node properties:
  compatible: must contain "marvell,berlin"

  In addition, the above compatible shall be extended with the specific
  SoC and board used. Currently known SoC compatibles are:
      "marvell,berlin2"      for Marvell Armada 1500 (BG2, 88DE3100),
      "marvell,berlin2cd"    for Marvell Armada 1500-mini (BG2CD, 88DE3005)
      "marvell,berlin2ct"    for Marvell Armada ? (BG2CT, 88DE????)
      "marvell,berlin2q"     for Marvell Armada 1500-pro (BG2Q, 88DE3114)
      "marvell,berlin3"      for Marvell Armada ? (BG3, 88DE????)

  * Example:

  / {
  	model = "Sony NSZ-GS7";
  	compatible = "sony,nsz-gs7", "marvell,berlin2", "marvell,berlin";

  	...
  }

  * Marvell Berlin CPU control bindings

  CPU control register allows various operations on CPUs, like resetting them
  independently.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "marvell,berlin-cpu-ctrl"
  - reg: address and length of the register set

...
