  Boards with a SoC of the Marvell Kirkwood
  shall have the following property:

  Required root node property:

  compatible: must contain "marvell,kirkwood";

  In order to support the kirkwood cpufreq driver, there must be a node
  cpus/cpu@0 with three clocks, "cpu_clk", "ddrclk" and "powersave",
  where the "powersave" clock is a gating clock used to switch the CPU
  between the "cpu_clk" and the "ddrclk".

  Example:

  	cpus {
  		#address-cells = <1>;
  		#size-cells = <0>;

  		cpu@0 {
  		      device_type = "cpu";
  		      compatible = "marvell,sheeva-88SV131";
  		      clocks = <&core_clk 1>, <&core_clk 3>, <&gate_clk 11>;
  		      clock-names = "cpu_clk", "ddrclk", "powersave";
  		};
             

properties:
  compatible: {}
examples:

    cpus {
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;

      cpu@0 {
