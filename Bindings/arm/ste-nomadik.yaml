  For various board the "board" node may contain specific properties
  that pertain to this particular board, such as board-specific GPIOs.

  Required root node property: src
  - Nomadik System and reset controller used for basic chip control, clock
    and reset line control.
  - compatible: must be "stericsson,nomadik,src"

  Boards with the Nomadik SoC include:

  Nomadik NHK-15 board manufactured by ST Microelectronics:

  Required root node property:

  compatible="st,nomadik-nhk-15";

  S8815 "MiniKit" manufactured by Calao Systems:

  Required root node property:

  compatible="calaosystems,usb-s8815";

  Required node: usb-s8815

  Example:

  usb-s8815 {
  		ethernet-gpio {
  			gpios = <&gpio3 19 0x1>;
  			interrupts = <19 0x1>;
  			interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
  		};
  		mmcsd-gpio {
  			gpios = <&gpio3 16 0x1>;
  		};
  };
