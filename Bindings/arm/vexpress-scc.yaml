description: |+
  Test chips for ARM Versatile Express platform implement SCC (Serial
  Configuration Controller) interface, used to set initial conditions
  for the test chip.

  In some cases its registers are also mapped in normal address space
  and can be used to obtain runtime information about the chip internals
  (like silicon temperature sensors) and as interface to other subsystems
  like platform configuration control and power management.

             

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - const: arm,vexpress-scc,v2p-ca15_a7
      - const: arm,vexpress-scc

    maxItems: 2
    additionalItems: false

  ARM Versatile Express Serial Configuration Controller
  -----------------------------------------------------

  Test chips for ARM Versatile Express platform implement SCC (Serial
  Configuration Controller) interface, used to set initial conditions
  for the test chip.

  In some cases its registers are also mapped in normal address space
  and can be used to obtain runtime information about the chip internals
  (like silicon temperature sensors) and as interface to other subsystems
  like platform configuration control and power management.

  Required properties:

  - compatible value: "arm,vexpress-scc,<model>", "arm,vexpress-scc";
  		    where <model> is the full tile model name (as used
  		    in the tile's Technical Reference Manual),
  		    eg. for Coretile Express A15x2 A7x3 (V2P-CA15_A7):
  	compatible = "arm,vexpress-scc,v2p-ca15_a7", "arm,vexpress-scc";

  Optional properties:

  - reg: when the SCC is memory mapped, physical address and size of the
         registers window
  - interrupts: when the SCC can generate a system-level interrupt
