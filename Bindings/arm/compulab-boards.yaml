  CompuLab SB-SOM is a multi-module baseboard capable of carrying:
   - CM-T43
   - CM-T54
   - CM-QS600
   - CL-SOM-AM57x
   - CL-SOM-iMX7
  modules with minor modifications to the SB-SOM assembly.

  Required root node properties:
      - compatible = should be "compulab,sb-som"

  Compulab CL-SOM-iMX7 is a miniature System-on-Module (SoM) based on
  Freescale i.MX7 ARM Cortex-A7 System-on-Chip.

  Required root node properties:
      - compatible = "compulab,cl-som-imx7", "fsl,imx7d";

  Compulab SBC-iMX7 is a single board computer based on the
  Freescale i.MX7 system-on-chip. SBC-iMX7 is implemented with
  the CL-SOM-iMX7 System-on-Module providing most of the functions,
  and SB-SOM-iMX7 carrier board providing additional peripheral
  functions and connectors.

  Required root node properties:
      - compatible = "compulab,sbc-imx7", "compulab,cl-som-imx7", "fsl,imx7d";
