  TI Keystone Platforms Device Tree Bindings
  -----------------------------------------------

  Boards with Keystone2 based devices (TCI66xxK2H) SOC shall have the
  following properties.

  Required properties:
   - compatible: All TI specific devices present in Keystone SOC should be in
     the form "ti,keystone-*". Generic devices like gic, arch_timers, ns16550
     type UART should use the specified compatible for those devices.

  SoC families:

  - Keystone 2 generic SoC:
     compatible = "ti,keystone"

  SoCs:

  - Keystone 2 Hawking/Kepler
     compatible = "ti,k2hk", "ti,keystone"
  - Keystone 2 Lamarr
     compatible = "ti,k2l", "ti,keystone"
  - Keystone 2 Edison
     compatible = "ti,k2e", "ti,keystone"
  - K2G
     compatible = "ti,k2g", "ti,keystone"

  Boards:
  -  Keystone 2 Hawking/Kepler EVM
     compatible = "ti,k2hk-evm", "ti,k2hk", "ti,keystone"

  -  Keystone 2 Lamarr EVM
     compatible = "ti,k2l-evm", "ti, k2l", "ti,keystone"

  -  Keystone 2 Edison EVM
     compatible = "ti,k2e-evm", "ti,k2e", "ti,keystone"

  -  K2G EVM
     compatible = "ti,k2g-evm", "ti,k2g", "ti-keystone"

  -  K2G Industrial Communication Engine EVM
     compatible = "ti,k2g-ice", "ti,k2g", "ti-keystone"
