title: Texas Instruments System Control Interface (TI-SCI) Message Protocol

description: |+
  Texas Instrument's processors including those belonging to Keystone generation
  of processors have separate hardware entity which is now responsible for the
  management of the System on Chip (SoC) system. These include various system
  level functions as well.

  An example of such an SoC is K2G, which contains the system control hardware
  block called Power Management Micro Controller (PMMC). This hardware block is
  initialized early into boot process and provides services to Operating Systems
  on multiple processors including ones running Linux.

  See http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/TISCI for protocol definition.

  TI-SCI controller Device Node:
  =============================

  The TI-SCI node describes the Texas Instrument's System Controller entity node.
  This parent node may optionally have additional children nodes which describe
  specific functionality such as clocks, power domain, reset or additional
  functionality as may be required for the SoC. This hierarchy also describes the
  relationship between the TI-SCI parent node to the child node.

  TI-SCI controller Device Node:
  =============================

  The TI-SCI node describes the Texas Instrument's System Controller entity node.
  This parent node may optionally have additional children nodes which describe
  specific functionality such as clocks, power domain, reset or additional
  functionality as may be required for the SoC. This hierarchy also describes the
  relationship between the TI-SCI parent node to the child node.

  Required properties:
  -------------------
  - compatible: should be "ti,k2g-sci"
  - mbox-names:
  	"rx" - Mailbox corresponding to receive path
  	"tx" - Mailbox corresponding to transmit path

  - mboxes: Mailboxes corresponding to the mbox-names. Each value of the mboxes
  	  property should contain a phandle to the mailbox controller device
  	  node and an args specifier that will be the phandle to the intended
  	  sub-mailbox child node to be used for communication.

  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/mailbox.txt for more details
  about the generic mailbox controller and client driver bindings. Also see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/ti,message-manager.txt for typical
  controller that is used to communicate with this System controllers.

  Optional Properties:
  -------------------
  - reg-names:
  	debug_messages - Map the Debug message region
  - reg:  register space corresponding to the debug_messages
  - ti,system-reboot-controller: If system reboot can be triggered by SoC reboot
