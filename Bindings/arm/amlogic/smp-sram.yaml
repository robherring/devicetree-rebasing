description: |+
  Amlogic's SMP-capable SoCs use part of the sram for the bringup of the cores.
  Once the core gets powered up it executes the code that is residing at a
  specific location.

  Therefore a reserved section sub-node has to be added to the mmio-sram
  declaration.

             

properties:
  compatible: {}
examples:
  - |
    sram: sram@d9000000 {
      compatible = "mmio-sram";
      reg = <0xd9000000 0x20000>;
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <1>;
      ranges = <0 0xd9000000 0x20000>;

  Amlogic Meson8 and Meson8b SRAM for smp bringup:
  ------------------------------------------------

  Amlogic's SMP-capable SoCs use part of the sram for the bringup of the cores.
  Once the core gets powered up it executes the code that is residing at a
  specific location.

  Therefore a reserved section sub-node has to be added to the mmio-sram
  declaration.

  Required sub-node properties:
  - compatible : depending on the SoC this should be one of:
  		"amlogic,meson8-smp-sram"
  		"amlogic,meson8b-smp-sram"

  The rest of the properties should follow the generic mmio-sram discription
  found in ../../misc/sram.txt
