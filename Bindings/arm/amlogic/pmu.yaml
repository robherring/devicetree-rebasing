  Amlogic Meson8 and Meson8b power-management-unit:
  -------------------------------------------------

  The pmu is used to turn off and on different power domains of the SoCs
  This includes the power to the CPU cores.

  Required node properties:
  - compatible value : depending on the SoC this should be one of:
  			"amlogic,meson8-pmu"
  			"amlogic,meson8b-pmu"
  - reg : physical base address and the size of the registers window
