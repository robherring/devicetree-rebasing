  NVIDIA compliant embedded controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "nvidia,nvec".
  - reg : the iomem of the i2c slave controller
  - interrupts : the interrupt line of the i2c slave controller
  - clock-frequency : the frequency of the i2c bus
  - gpios : the gpio used for ec request
  - slave-addr: the i2c address of the slave controller
  - clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names : Must include the following entries:
    Tegra20/Tegra30:
    - div-clk
    - fast-clk
    Tegra114:
    - div-clk
  - resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names : Must include the following entries:
    - i2c
