  NVIDIA Tegra Power Management Controller (PMC)

  == Power Management Controller Node ==

  The PMC block interacts with an external Power Management Unit. The PMC
  mostly controls the entry and exit of the system from different sleep
  modes. It provides power-gating controllers for SoC and CPU power-islands.

  Required properties:
  - name : Should be pmc
  - compatible : Should contain one of the following:
  	For Tegra20 must contain "nvidia,tegra20-pmc".
  	For Tegra30 must contain "nvidia,tegra30-pmc".
  	For Tegra114 must contain "nvidia,tegra114-pmc"
  	For Tegra124 must contain "nvidia,tegra124-pmc"
  	For Tegra132 must contain "nvidia,tegra124-pmc"
  	For Tegra210 must contain "nvidia,tegra210-pmc"
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
  - clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names : Must include the following entries:
    "pclk" (The Tegra clock of that name),
    "clk32k_in" (The 32KHz clock input to Tegra).

  Optional properties:
  - nvidia,invert-interrupt : If present, inverts the PMU interrupt signal.
    The PMU is an external Power Management Unit, whose interrupt output
    signal is fed into the PMC. This signal is optionally inverted, and then
    fed into the ARM GIC. The PMC is not involved in the detection or
    handling of this interrupt signal, merely its inversion.
  - nvidia,suspend-mode : The suspend mode that the platform should use.
    Valid values are 0, 1 and 2:
    0 (LP0): CPU + Core voltage off and DRAM in self-refresh
    1 (LP1): CPU voltage off and DRAM in self-refresh
    2 (LP2): CPU voltage off
  - nvidia,core-power-req-active-high : Boolean, core power request active-high
  - nvidia,sys-clock-req-active-high : Boolean, system clock request active-high
  - nvidia,combined-power-req : Boolean, combined power request for CPU & Core
  - nvidia,cpu-pwr-good-en : Boolean, CPU power good signal (from PMIC to PMC)
  			   is enabled.

  Required properties when nvidia,suspend-mode is specified:
  - nvidia,cpu-pwr-good-time : CPU power good time in uS.
  - nvidia,cpu-pwr-off-time : CPU power off time in uS.
  - nvidia,core-pwr-good-time : <Oscillator-stable-time Power-stable-time>
  			      Core power good time in uS.
  - nvidia,core-pwr-off-time : Core power off time in uS.

  Required properties when nvidia,suspend-mode=<0>:
  - nvidia,lp0-vec : <start length> Starting address and length of LP0 vector
    The LP0 vector contains the warm boot code that is executed by AVP when
    resuming from the LP0 state. The AVP (Audio-Video Processor) is an ARM7
    processor and always being the first boot processor when chip is power on
    or resume from deep sleep mode. When the system is resumed from the deep
    sleep mode, the warm boot code will restore some PLLs, clocks and then
    bring up CPU0 for resuming the system.

  Hardware-triggered thermal reset:
  On Tegra30, Tegra114 and Tegra124, if the 'i2c-thermtrip' subnode exists,
  hardware-triggered thermal reset will be enabled.

  Required properties for hardware-triggered thermal reset (inside 'i2c-thermtrip'):
  - nvidia,i2c-controller-id : ID of I2C controller to send poweroff command to. Valid values are
                               described in section 9.2.148 "APBDEV_PMC_SCRATCH53_0" of the
                               Tegra K1 Technical Reference Manual.
  - nvidia,bus-addr : Bus address of the PMU on the I2C bus
  - nvidia,reg-addr : I2C register address to write poweroff command to
  - nvidia,reg-data : Poweroff command to write to PMU

  Optional properties for hardware-triggered thermal reset (inside 'i2c-thermtrip'):
  - nvidia,pinmux-id : Pinmux used by the hardware when issuing poweroff command.
                       Defaults to 0. Valid values are described in section 12.5.2
                       "Pinmux Support" of the Tegra4 Technical Reference Manual.

  Optional nodes:
  - powergates : This node contains a hierarchy of power domain nodes, which
  	       should match the powergates on the Tegra SoC. See "Powergate
  	       Nodes" below.
