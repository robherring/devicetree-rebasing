  * MSM Timer

  Properties:

  - compatible : Should at least contain "qcom,msm-timer". More specific
                 properties specify which subsystem the timers are paired with.

                 "qcom,kpss-timer" - krait subsystem
                 "qcom,scss-timer" - scorpion subsystem

  - interrupts : Interrupts for the debug timer, the first general purpose
                 timer, and optionally a second general purpose timer, and
                 optionally as well, 2 watchdog interrupts, in that order.

  - reg : Specifies the base address of the timer registers.

  - clocks: Reference to the parent clocks, one per output clock. The parents
            must appear in the same order as the clock names.

  - clock-names: The name of the clocks as free-form strings. They should be in
                 the same order as the clocks.

  - clock-frequency : The frequency of the debug timer and the general purpose
                      timer(s) in Hz in that order.

  Optional:

  - cpu-offset : per-cpu offset used when the timer is accessed without the
                 CPU remapping facilities. The offset is
                 cpu-offset + (0x10000 * cpu-nr).
