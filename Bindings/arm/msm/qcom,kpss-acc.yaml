title: Krait Processor Sub-system (KPSS) Application Clock Controller (ACC)

maintainers:
  - Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>
description: |
  The KPSS ACC provides clock, power domain, and reset control to a Krait CPU.
  There is one ACC register region per CPU within the KPSS remapped region as
  well as an alias register region that remaps accesses to the ACC associated
  with the CPU accessing the region.

  PROPERTIES

  - compatible:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <string>
  	Definition: should be one of:
  			"qcom,kpss-acc-v1"
  			"qcom,kpss-acc-v2"

  - reg:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition: the first element specifies the base address and size of
  		    the register region. An optional second element specifies
  		    the base address and size of the alias register region.

  Example:

  	clock-controller@2088000 {
  		compatible = "qcom,kpss-acc-v2";
  		reg = <0x02088000 0x1000>,
  		      <0x02008000 0x1000>;
  	};
