  * Qualcomm SSBI

  Some Qualcomm MSM devices contain a point-to-point serial bus used to
  communicate with a limited range of devices (mostly power management
  chips).

  These require the following properties:

  - compatible: "qcom,ssbi"

  - qcom,controller-type
    indicates the SSBI bus variant the controller should use to talk
    with the slave device.  This should be one of "ssbi", "ssbi2", or
    "pmic-arbiter".  The type chosen is determined by the attached
    slave.

  The slave device should be the single child node of the ssbi device
  with a compatible field.
