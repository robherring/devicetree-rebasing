  Broadcom Hurricane 2 family of SoCs are used for switching control. These SoCs
  are based on Broadcom's iProc SoC architecture and feature a single core Cortex
  A9 ARM CPUs, DDR2/DDR3 memory, PCIe GEN-2, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, serial and NAND
  flash and a PCIe attached integrated switching engine.
