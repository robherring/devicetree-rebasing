  SAMSUNG Exynos SoC series PMU Registers

  Properties:
   - compatible : should contain two values. First value must be one from following list:
  		   - "samsung,exynos3250-pmu" - for Exynos3250 SoC,
  		   - "samsung,exynos4210-pmu" - for Exynos4210 SoC,
  		   - "samsung,exynos4412-pmu" - for Exynos4412 SoC,
  		   - "samsung,exynos5250-pmu" - for Exynos5250 SoC,
  		   - "samsung,exynos5260-pmu" - for Exynos5260 SoC.
  		   - "samsung,exynos5410-pmu" - for Exynos5410 SoC,
  		   - "samsung,exynos5420-pmu" - for Exynos5420 SoC.
  		   - "samsung,exynos5433-pmu" - for Exynos5433 SoC.
  		   - "samsung,exynos7-pmu" - for Exynos7 SoC.
  		second value must be always "syscon".

   - reg : offset and length of the register set.

   - #clock-cells : must be <1>, since PMU requires once cell as clock specifier.
  		The single specifier cell is used as index to list of clocks
  		provided by PMU, which is currently:
  			0 : SoC clock output (CLKOUT pin)

   - clock-names : list of clock names for particular CLKOUT mux inputs in
  		following format:
  			"clkoutN", where N is a decimal number corresponding to
  			CLKOUT mux control bits value for given input, e.g.
  				"clkout0", "clkout7", "clkout15".

   - clocks : list of phandles and specifiers to all input clocks listed in
  		clock-names property.

  Optional properties:

  Some PMUs are capable of behaving as an interrupt controller (mostly
  to wake up a suspended PMU). In which case, they can have the
  following properties:

  - interrupt-controller: indicate that said PMU is an interrupt controller

  - #interrupt-cells: must be identical to the that of the parent interrupt
    controller.

  - interrupt-parent: a phandle indicating which interrupt controller
    this PMU signals interrupts to.
