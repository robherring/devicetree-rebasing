description: |+
  The devicetree bindings are for the new ADC driver written for
  Exynos4 and upward SoCs from Samsung.

  New driver handles the following
  1. Supports ADC IF found on EXYNOS4412/EXYNOS5250
     and future SoCs from Samsung
  2. Add ADC driver under iio/adc framework
  3. Also adds the Documentation for device tree bindings

  Samsung Exynos Analog to Digital Converter bindings

  The devicetree bindings are for the new ADC driver written for
  Exynos4 and upward SoCs from Samsung.

  New driver handles the following
  1. Supports ADC IF found on EXYNOS4412/EXYNOS5250
     and future SoCs from Samsung
  2. Add ADC driver under iio/adc framework
  3. Also adds the Documentation for device tree bindings

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Must be "samsung,exynos-adc-v1"
  				for exynos4412/5250 and s5pv210 controllers.
  			Must be "samsung,exynos-adc-v2" for
  				future controllers.
  			Must be "samsung,exynos3250-adc" for
  				controllers compatible with ADC of Exynos3250.
  			Must be "samsung,exynos7-adc" for
  				the ADC in Exynos7 and compatibles
  			Must be "samsung,s3c2410-adc" for
  				the ADC in s3c2410 and compatibles
  			Must be "samsung,s3c2416-adc" for
  				the ADC in s3c2416 and compatibles
  			Must be "samsung,s3c2440-adc" for
  				the ADC in s3c2440 and compatibles
  			Must be "samsung,s3c2443-adc" for
  				the ADC in s3c2443 and compatibles
  			Must be "samsung,s3c6410-adc" for
  				the ADC in s3c6410 and compatibles
  - reg:			List of ADC register address range
  			- The base address and range of ADC register
  			- The base address and range of ADC_PHY register (every
  			  SoC except for s3c24xx/s3c64xx ADC)
  - interrupts: 		Contains the interrupt information for the timer. The
  			format is being dependent on which interrupt controller
  			the Samsung device uses.
  - #io-channel-cells = <1>; As ADC has multiple outputs
  - clocks		From common clock bindings: handles to clocks specified
  			in "clock-names" property, in the same order.
  - clock-names		From common clock bindings: list of clock input names
  			used by ADC block:
  			- "adc" : ADC bus clock
  			- "sclk" : ADC special clock (only for Exynos3250 and
  				   compatible ADC block)
  - vdd-supply		VDD input supply.

  - samsung,syscon-phandle Contains the PMU system controller node
  			(To access the ADC_PHY register on Exynos5250/5420/5800/3250)
  Optional properties:
  - has-touchscreen:	If present, indicates that a touchscreen is
  			connected an usable.

  Note: child nodes can be added for auto probing from device tree.
