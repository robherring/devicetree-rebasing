  ARM 11MP, Cortex-A5 and Cortex-A9 are often associated with a per-core
  Timer-Watchdog (aka TWD), which provides both a per-cpu local timer
  and watchdog.

  The TWD is usually attached to a GIC to deliver its two per-processor
  interrupts.

  compatible: {}
examples:

    twd-timer@2c000600 {
      compatible = "arm,arm11mp-twd-timer"";
      reg = <0x2c000600 0x20>;
      interrupts = <1 13 0xf01>;
    };

    ** Watchdog node properties:

    - compatible : Should be one of:
    "arm,cortex-a9-twd-wdt"
    "arm,cortex-a5-twd-wdt"
    "arm,arm11mp-twd-wdt"

    - interrupts : One interrupt to each core

    - reg : Specify the base address and the size of the TWD watchdog
    register window.

    Example:

    twd-watchdog@2c000620 {
      compatible = "arm,arm11mp-twd-wdt";
      reg = <0x2c000620 0x20>;

  * ARM Timer Watchdog

  ARM 11MP, Cortex-A5 and Cortex-A9 are often associated with a per-core
  Timer-Watchdog (aka TWD), which provides both a per-cpu local timer
  and watchdog.

  The TWD is usually attached to a GIC to deliver its two per-processor
  interrupts.

  ** Timer node required properties:

  - compatible : Should be one of:
  	"arm,cortex-a9-twd-timer"
  	"arm,cortex-a5-twd-timer"
  	"arm,arm11mp-twd-timer"

  - interrupts : One interrupt to each core

  - reg : Specify the base address and the size of the TWD timer
  	register window.

  Optional

  - always-on : a boolean property. If present, the timer is powered through
    an always-on power domain, therefore it never loses context.
