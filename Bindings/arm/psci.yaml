description: |+
  Firmware implementing the PSCI functions described in ARM document number
  ARM DEN 0022A ("Power State Coordination Interface System Software on ARM
  processors") can be used by Linux to initiate various CPU-centric power
  operations.

  Issue A of the specification describes functions for CPU suspend, hotplug
  and migration of secure software.

  Functions are invoked by trapping to the privilege level of the PSCI
  firmware (specified as part of the binding below) and passing arguments
  in a manner similar to that specified by AAPCS:

  	 r0		=> 32-bit Function ID / return value
  	{r1 - r3}	=> Parameters

  Note that the immediate field of the trapping instruction must be set
  to #0.

  * Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)

  Firmware implementing the PSCI functions described in ARM document number
  ARM DEN 0022A ("Power State Coordination Interface System Software on ARM
  processors") can be used by Linux to initiate various CPU-centric power
  operations.

  Issue A of the specification describes functions for CPU suspend, hotplug
  and migration of secure software.

  Functions are invoked by trapping to the privilege level of the PSCI
  firmware (specified as part of the binding below) and passing arguments
  in a manner similar to that specified by AAPCS:

  	 r0		=> 32-bit Function ID / return value
  	{r1 - r3}	=> Parameters

  Note that the immediate field of the trapping instruction must be set
  to #0.


  Main node required properties:

   - compatible    : should contain at least one of:

       * "arm,psci"     : For implementations complying to PSCI versions prior
  			to 0.2.
  			For these cases function IDs must be provided.

       * "arm,psci-0.2" : For implementations complying to PSCI 0.2.
  			Function IDs are not required and should be ignored by
  			an OS with PSCI 0.2 support, but are permitted to be
  			present for compatibility with existing software when
  			"arm,psci" is later in the compatible list.

       * "arm,psci-1.0" : For implementations complying to PSCI 1.0.
  			PSCI 1.0 is backward compatible with PSCI 0.2 with
  			minor specification updates, as defined in the PSCI
  			specification[2].

   - method        : The method of calling the PSCI firmware. Permitted
                     values are:

                     "smc" : SMC #0, with the register assignments specified
  		           in this binding.

                     "hvc" : HVC #0, with the register assignments specified
  		           in this binding.

  Main node optional properties:

   - cpu_suspend   : Function ID for CPU_SUSPEND operation

   - cpu_off       : Function ID for CPU_OFF operation

   - cpu_on        : Function ID for CPU_ON operation

   - migrate       : Function ID for MIGRATE operation

  Device tree nodes that require usage of PSCI CPU_SUSPEND function (ie idle
  state nodes, as per bindings in [1]) must specify the following properties:

  - arm,psci-suspend-param
  		Usage: Required for state nodes[1] if the corresponding
                         idle-states node entry-method property is set
                         to "psci".
  		Value type: <u32>
  		Definition: power_state parameter to pass to the PSCI
  			    suspend call.
