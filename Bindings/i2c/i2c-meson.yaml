  Amlogic Meson I2C controller

  Required properties:
   - compatible: must be:
  	"amlogic,meson6-i2c" for Meson8 and compatible SoCs
  	"amlogic,meson-gxbb-i2c" for GXBB and compatible SoCs
  	"amlogic,meson-axg-i2c"for AXG and compatible SoCs

   - reg: physical address and length of the device registers
   - interrupts: a single interrupt specifier
   - clocks: clock for the device
   - #address-cells: should be <1>
   - #size-cells: should be <0>

  For details regarding the following core I2C bindings see also i2c.txt.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-frequency: the desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz; in
    absence of this property the default value is used (100 kHz).
