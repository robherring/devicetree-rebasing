  * Samsung's High Speed I2C controller

  The Samsung's High Speed I2C controller is used to interface with I2C devices
  at various speeds ranging from 100khz to 3.4Mhz.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: value should be.
  	-> "samsung,exynos5-hsi2c", (DEPRECATED)
  				for i2c compatible with HSI2C available
  				on Exynos5250 and Exynos5420 SoCs.
  	-> "samsung,exynos5250-hsi2c", for i2c compatible with HSI2C available
  				on Exynos5250 and Exynos5420 SoCs.
  	-> "samsung,exynos5260-hsi2c", for i2c compatible with HSI2C available
  				on Exynos5260 SoCs.
  	-> "samsung,exynos7-hsi2c", for i2c compatible with HSI2C available
  				on Exynos7 SoCs.

    - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
      region.
    - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
    - #address-cells: always 1 (for i2c addresses)
    - #size-cells: always 0

    - Pinctrl:
      - pinctrl-0: Pin control group to be used for this controller.
      - pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".

  Optional properties:
    - clock-frequency: Desired operating frequency in Hz of the bus.
      -> If not specified, the bus operates in fast-speed mode at
         at 100khz.
      -> If specified, the bus operates in high-speed mode only if the
         clock-frequency is >= 1Mhz.
