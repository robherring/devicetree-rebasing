  Device tree configuration for the I2C busses on the AST24XX and AST25XX SoCs.

  Required Properties:
  - #address-cells	: should be 1
  - #size-cells		: should be 0
  - reg			: address offset and range of bus
  - compatible		: should be "aspeed,ast2400-i2c-bus"
  			  or "aspeed,ast2500-i2c-bus"
  - clocks		: root clock of bus, should reference the APB
  			  clock in the second cell
  - resets		: phandle to reset controller with the reset number in
  			  the second cell
  - interrupts		: interrupt number
  - interrupt-parent	: interrupt controller for bus, should reference a
  			  aspeed,ast2400-i2c-ic or aspeed,ast2500-i2c-ic
  			  interrupt controller

  Optional Properties:
  - bus-frequency	: frequency of the bus clock in Hz defaults to 100 kHz when not
  		  specified
  - multi-master	: states that there is another master active on this bus.
