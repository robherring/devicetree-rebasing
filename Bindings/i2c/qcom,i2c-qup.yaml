  Qualcomm Universal Peripheral (QUP) I2C controller

  Required properties:
   - compatible: Should be:
     * "qcom,i2c-qup-v1.1.1" for 8660, 8960 and 8064.
     * "qcom,i2c-qup-v2.1.1" for 8974 v1.
     * "qcom,i2c-qup-v2.2.1" for 8974 v2 and later.
   - reg: Should contain QUP register address and length.
   - interrupts: Should contain I2C interrupt.

   - clocks: A list of phandles + clock-specifiers, one for each entry in
     clock-names.
   - clock-names: Should contain:
     * "core" for the core clock
     * "iface" for the AHB clock

   - #address-cells: Should be <1> Address cells for i2c device address
   - #size-cells: Should be <0> as i2c addresses have no size component

  Optional properties:
   - clock-frequency: Should specify the desired i2c bus clock frequency in Hz,
                      defaults to 100kHz if omitted.

  Child nodes should conform to i2c bus binding.
