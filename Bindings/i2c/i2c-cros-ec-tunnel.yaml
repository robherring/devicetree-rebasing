  I2C bus that tunnels through the ChromeOS EC (cros-ec)
  ======================================================
  On some ChromeOS board designs we've got a connection to the EC (embedded
  controller) but no direct connection to some devices on the other side of
  the EC (like a battery and PMIC).  To get access to those devices we need
  to tunnel our i2c commands through the EC.

  The node for this device should be under a cros-ec node like google,cros-ec-spi
  or google,cros-ec-i2c.


  Required properties:
  - compatible: google,cros-ec-i2c-tunnel
  - google,remote-bus: The EC bus we'd like to talk to.

  Optional child nodes:
  - One node per I2C device connected to the tunnelled I2C bus.
