  Device tree configuration for i2c-ocores

  Required properties:
  - compatible      : "opencores,i2c-ocores" or "aeroflexgaisler,i2cmst"
  - reg             : bus address start and address range size of device
  - interrupts      : interrupt number
  - clocks          : handle to the controller clock; see the note below.
                      Mutually exclusive with opencores,ip-clock-frequency
  - opencores,ip-clock-frequency: frequency of the controller clock in Hz;
                      see the note below. Mutually exclusive with clocks
  - #address-cells  : should be <1>
  - #size-cells     : should be <0>

  Optional properties:
  - clock-frequency : frequency of bus clock in Hz; see the note below.
                      Defaults to 100 KHz when the property is not specified
  - reg-shift       : device register offsets are shifted by this value
  - reg-io-width    : io register width in bytes (1, 2 or 4)
  - regstep         : deprecated, use reg-shift above

  Note
  clock-frequency property is meant to control the bus frequency for i2c bus
  drivers, but it was incorrectly used to specify i2c controller input clock
  frequency. So the following rules are set to fix this situation:
  - if clock-frequency is present and neither opencores,ip-clock-frequency nor
    clocks are, then clock-frequency specifies i2c controller clock frequency.
    This is to keep backwards compatibility with setups using old DTB. i2c bus
    frequency is fixed at 100 KHz.
  - if clocks is present it specifies i2c controller clock. clock-frequency
    property specifies i2c bus frequency.
  - if opencores,ip-clock-frequency is present it specifies i2c controller
    clock frequency. clock-frequency property specifies i2c bus frequency.
