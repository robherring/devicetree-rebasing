  Device-Tree bindings for i2c gpio driver

  Required properties:
  	- compatible = "i2c-gpio";
  	- sda-gpios: gpio used for the sda signal, this should be flagged as
  	  active high using open drain with (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH|GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN)
  	  from <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h> since the signal is by definition
  	  open drain.
  	- scl-gpios: gpio used for the scl signal, this should be flagged as
  	  active high using open drain with (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH|GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN)
  	  from <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h> since the signal is by definition
  	  open drain.

  Optional properties:
  	- i2c-gpio,scl-output-only: scl as output only
  	- i2c-gpio,delay-us: delay between GPIO operations (may depend on each platform)
  	- i2c-gpio,timeout-ms: timeout to get data

  Deprecated properties, do not use in new device tree sources:
  	- gpios: sda and scl gpio, alternative for {sda,scl}-gpios
  	- i2c-gpio,sda-open-drain: this means that something outside of our
  	  control has put the GPIO line used for SDA into open drain mode, and
  	  that something is not the GPIO chip. It is essentially an
  	  inconsistency flag.
  	- i2c-gpio,scl-open-drain: this means that something outside of our
  	  control has put the GPIO line used for SCL into open drain mode, and
  	  that something is not the GPIO chip. It is essentially an
  	  inconsistency flag.
