  I2C for R-Car platforms

  Required properties:
  - compatible:
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7743" if the device is a part of a R8A7743 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7745" if the device is a part of a R8A7745 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7778" if the device is a part of a R8A7778 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7779" if the device is a part of a R8A7779 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7790" if the device is a part of a R8A7790 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7791" if the device is a part of a R8A7791 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7792" if the device is a part of a R8A7792 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7793" if the device is a part of a R8A7793 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7794" if the device is a part of a R8A7794 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7795" if the device is a part of a R8A7795 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a7796" if the device is a part of a R8A7796 SoC.
  	"renesas,i2c-r8a77970" if the device is a part of a R8A77970 SoC.
  	"renesas,rcar-gen1-i2c" for a generic R-Car Gen1 compatible device.
  	"renesas,rcar-gen2-i2c" for a generic R-Car Gen2 or RZ/G1 compatible
  				device.
  	"renesas,rcar-gen3-i2c" for a generic R-Car Gen3 compatible device.
  	"renesas,i2c-rcar" (deprecated)

  	When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
  	SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first followed
  	by the generic version.

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupts: interrupt specifier.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-frequency: desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. The absence of this
    property indicates the default frequency 100 kHz.
  - clocks: clock specifier.
  - dmas: Must contain a list of two references to DMA specifiers, one for
    transmission, and one for reception.
  - dma-names: Must contain a list of two DMA names, "tx" and "rx".

  - i2c-scl-internal-delay-ns: see i2c.txt
  - i2c-scl-rising-time-ns: see i2c.txt
