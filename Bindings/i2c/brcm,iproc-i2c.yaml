  Broadcom iProc I2C controller

  Required properties:

  - compatible:
      Must be "brcm,iproc-i2c"

  - reg:
      Define the base and range of the I/O address space that contain the iProc
      I2C controller registers

  - interrupts:
      Should contain the I2C interrupt

  - clock-frequency:
      This is the I2C bus clock. Need to be either 100000 or 400000

  - #address-cells:
      Always 1 (for I2C addresses)

  - #size-cells:
      Always 0
