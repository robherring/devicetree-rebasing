description: |+
  An i2c bus multiplexer/switch will have several child busses that are
  numbered uniquely in a device dependent manner.  The nodes for an i2c bus
  multiplexer/switch will have one child node for each child bus.

  Common i2c bus multiplexer/switch properties.

  An i2c bus multiplexer/switch will have several child busses that are
  numbered uniquely in a device dependent manner.  The nodes for an i2c bus
  multiplexer/switch will have one child node for each child bus.

  Optional properties:
  - #address-cells = <1>;
     This property is required if the i2c-mux child node does not exist.

  - #size-cells = <0>;
     This property is required if the i2c-mux child node does not exist.

  - i2c-mux
     For i2c multiplexers/switches that have child nodes that are a mixture
     of both i2c child busses and other child nodes, the 'i2c-mux' subnode
     can be used for populating the i2c child busses.  If an 'i2c-mux'
     subnode is present, only subnodes of this will be considered as i2c
     child busses.

  Required properties for the i2c-mux child node:
  - #address-cells = <1>;
  - #size-cells = <0>;

  Required properties for i2c child bus nodes:
  - #address-cells = <1>;
  - #size-cells = <0>;
  - reg : The sub-bus number.

  Optional properties for i2c child bus nodes:
  - Other properties specific to the multiplexer/switch hardware.
  - Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding
