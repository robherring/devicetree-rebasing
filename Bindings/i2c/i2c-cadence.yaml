  Binding for the Cadence I2C controller

  Required properties:
    - reg: Physical base address and size of the controller's register area.
    - compatible: Should contain one of:
  		* "cdns,i2c-r1p10"
  		Note:	Use this when cadence i2c controller version 1.0 is used.
  		* "cdns,i2c-r1p14"
  		Note:	Use this when cadence i2c controller version 1.4 is used.
    - clocks: Input clock specifier. Refer to common clock bindings.
    - interrupts: Interrupt specifier. Refer to interrupt bindings.
    - #address-cells: Should be 1.
    - #size-cells: Should be 0.

  Optional properties:
    - clock-frequency: Desired operating frequency, in Hz, of the bus.
    - clock-names: Input clock name, should be 'pclk'.
