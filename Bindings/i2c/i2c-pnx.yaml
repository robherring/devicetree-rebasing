  * NXP PNX I2C Controller

  Required properties:

   - reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
   - compatible: should be "nxp,pnx-i2c"
   - interrupts: configure one interrupt line
   - #address-cells: always 1 (for i2c addresses)
   - #size-cells: always 0
   - interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller that
     services interrupts for this device.

  Optional properties:

   - clock-frequency: desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz, Default: 100000 Hz

...
