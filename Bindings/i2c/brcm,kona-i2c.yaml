description: |
  This I2C controller is used in the following Broadcom SoCs:

    BCM11130
    BCM11140
    BCM11351
    BCM28145
    BCM28155

  Required Properties
  -------------------
  - compatible: "brcm,bcm11351-i2c", "brcm,kona-i2c"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of controller registers
  - interrupts: The interrupt number used by the controller
  - clocks: clock specifier for the kona i2c external clock
  - clock-frequency: The I2C bus frequency in Hz
  - #address-cells: Should be <1>
  - #size-cells: Should be <0>

  Refer to clocks/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer
  properties.

  Example:

  i2c@3e016000 {
  	compatible = "brcm,bcm11351-i2c","brcm,kona-i2c";
  	reg = <0x3e016000 0x80>;
  	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 103 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
  	clocks = <&bsc1_clk>;
  	clock-frequency = <400000>;
  	#address-cells = <1>;
  	#size-cells = <0>;
  };
