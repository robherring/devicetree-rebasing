  Required properties :

   - reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
   - compatible      : Should one of the following:
                       - "allwinner,sun6i-a31-p2wi"
   - interrupts      : The interrupt line connected to the P2WI peripheral.
   - clocks          : The gate clk connected to the P2WI peripheral.
   - resets          : The reset line connected to the P2WI peripheral.

  Optional properties :

   - clock-frequency : Desired P2WI bus clock frequency in Hz. If not set the
  default frequency is 100kHz

  A P2WI may contain one child node encoding a P2WI slave device.
