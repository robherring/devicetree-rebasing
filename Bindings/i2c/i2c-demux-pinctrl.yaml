description: |+
  This binding describes an I2C bus demultiplexer that uses pin multiplexing to
  route the I2C signals, and represents the pin multiplexing configuration using
  the pinctrl device tree bindings. This may be used to select one I2C IP core at
  runtime which may have a better feature set for a given task than another I2C
  IP core on the SoC. The most simple example is to fall back to GPIO bitbanging
  if your current runtime configuration hits an errata of the internal IP core.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "i2c-demux-pinctrl"
  - i2c-parent: List of phandles of I2C masters available for selection. The first
  	      one will be used as default.
  - i2c-bus-name: The name of this bus. Also needed as pinctrl-name for the I2C
  		parents.

  Furthermore, I2C mux properties and child nodes. See i2c-mux.txt in this
  directory.
