title: NXP PCA PCA9564/PCA9665 I2C controller

maintainers:
  - Chris Packham <chris.packham@alliedtelesis.co.nz>
description: |
  The PCA9564/PCA9665 serves as an interface between most standard
  parallel-bus microcontrollers/microprocessors and the serial I2C-bus
  and allows the parallel bus system to communicate bi-directionally
  with the I2C-bus.

  Required properties :

   - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
   - compatible : one of "nxp,pca9564" or "nxp,pca9665"

  Optional properties
   - interrupts : the interrupt number
   - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller.
     If an interrupt is not specified polling will be used.
   - reset-gpios : gpio specifier for gpio connected to RESET_N pin. As the line
     is active low, it should be marked GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW.
   - clock-frequency : I2C bus frequency.

  Example:
  	i2c0: i2c@80000 {
  		compatible = "nxp,pca9564";
  		#address-cells = <1>;
  		#size-cells = <0>;
  		reg = <0x80000 0x4>;
  		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
  		clock-frequency = <100000>;
  	};
             

properties:
  compatible: {}

    i2c0: i2c@80000 {
      compatible = "nxp,pca9564";
      #address-cells = <1>;
