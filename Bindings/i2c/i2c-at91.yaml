  I2C for Atmel platforms

  Required properties :
  - compatible : Must be "atmel,at91rm9200-i2c", "atmel,at91sam9261-i2c",
       "atmel,at91sam9260-i2c", "atmel,at91sam9g20-i2c", "atmel,at91sam9g10-i2c",
       "atmel,at91sam9x5-i2c", "atmel,sama5d4-i2c" or "atmel,sama5d2-i2c"
  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
       region.
  - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
  - #address-cells = <1>;
  - #size-cells = <0>;
  - clocks: phandles to input clocks.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-frequency: Desired I2C bus frequency in Hz, otherwise defaults to 100000
  - dmas: A list of two dma specifiers, one for each entry in dma-names.
  - dma-names: should contain "tx" and "rx".
  - atmel,fifo-size: maximum number of data the RX and TX FIFOs can store for FIFO
    capable I2C controllers.
  - i2c-sda-hold-time-ns: TWD hold time, only available for "atmel,sama5d4-i2c"
    and "atmel,sama5d2-i2c".
  - Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding
