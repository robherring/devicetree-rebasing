  * SBSA (Server Base System Architecture) Generic Watchdog

  The SBSA Generic Watchdog Timer is used to force a reset of the system
  after two stages of timeout have elapsed.  A detailed definition of the
  watchdog timer can be found in the ARM document: ARM-DEN-0029 - Server
  Base System Architecture (SBSA)

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should at least contain "arm,sbsa-gwdt".

  - reg: Each entry specifies the base physical address of a register frame
    and the length of that frame; currently, two frames must be defined,
    in this order:
    1: Watchdog control frame;
    2: Refresh frame.

  - interrupts: Should contain the Watchdog Signal 0 (WS0) SPI (Shared
    Peripheral Interrupt) number of SBSA Generic Watchdog.

  Optional properties
  - timeout-sec: Watchdog timeout values (in seconds).
