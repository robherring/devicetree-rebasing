  corresponding to the parent RAVE SP device (as documented in

  Zodiac Inflight Innovations RAVE Supervisory Processor Watchdog Bindings

  RAVE SP watchdog device is a "MFD cell" device corresponding to
  watchdog functionality of RAVE Supervisory Processor. It is expected
  that its Device Tree node is specified as a child of the node
  corresponding to the parent RAVE SP device (as documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/zii,rave-sp.txt)

  Required properties:

  - compatible: Depending on wire protocol implemented by RAVE SP
    firmware, should be one of:
  	- "zii,rave-sp-watchdog"
  	- "zii,rave-sp-watchdog-legacy"

  Optional properties:

  - wdt-timeout:	Two byte nvmem cell specified as per
  		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

...
