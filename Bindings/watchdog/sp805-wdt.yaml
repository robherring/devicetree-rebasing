  SP805 WDT is a ARM Primecell Peripheral and has a standard-id register that
  can be used to identify the peripheral type, vendor, and revision.
  This value can be used for driver matching.

  As SP805 WDT is a primecell IP, it follows the base bindings specified in
  'arm/primecell.txt'

  * ARM SP805 Watchdog Timer (WDT) Controller

  SP805 WDT is a ARM Primecell Peripheral and has a standard-id register that
  can be used to identify the peripheral type, vendor, and revision.
  This value can be used for driver matching.

  As SP805 WDT is a primecell IP, it follows the base bindings specified in
  'arm/primecell.txt'

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "arm,sp805-wdt", "arm,primecell"
  - reg : Base address and size of the watchdog timer registers.
  - clocks : From common clock binding.
             First clock is PCLK and the second is WDOGCLK.
             WDOGCLK can be equal to or be a sub-multiple of the PCLK frequency.
  - clock-names : From common clock binding.
                  Shall be "apb_pclk" for first clock and "wdog_clk" for the
                  second one.

  Optional properties:
  - interrupts : Should specify WDT interrupt number.
