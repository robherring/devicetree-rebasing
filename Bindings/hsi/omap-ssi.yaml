  OMAP SSI controller bindings

  OMAP3's Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) controller implements a
  legacy variant of MIPI's High Speed Synchronous Serial Interface (HSI),
  while the controller found inside OMAP4 is supposed to be fully compliant
  with the HSI standard.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Should include "ti,omap3-ssi" or "ti,omap4-hsi"
  - reg-names:		Contains the values "sys" and "gdd" (in this order).
  - reg:			Contains a matching register specifier for each entry
  			in reg-names.
  - interrupt-names:	Contains the value "gdd_mpu".
  - interrupts: 		Contains matching interrupt information for each entry
  			in interrupt-names.
  - ranges:		Represents the bus address mapping between the main
  			controller node and the child nodes below.
  - clock-names:		Must include the following entries:
    "ssi_ssr_fck": The OMAP clock of that name
    "ssi_sst_fck": The OMAP clock of that name
    "ssi_ick": The OMAP clock of that name
  - clocks:		Contains a matching clock specifier for each entry in
  			clock-names.
  - #address-cells:	Should be set to <1>
  - #size-cells:		Should be set to <1>

  Each port is represented as a sub-node of the ti,omap3-ssi device.

  Required Port sub-node properties:
  - compatible:		Should be set to the following value
  			ti,omap3-ssi-port (applicable to OMAP34xx devices)
  			ti,omap4-hsi-port (applicable to OMAP44xx devices)
  - reg-names:		Contains the values "tx" and "rx" (in this order).
  - reg:			Contains a matching register specifier for each entry
  			in reg-names.
  - interrupt-parent	Should be a phandle for the interrupt controller
  - interrupts:		Should contain interrupt specifiers for mpu interrupts
  			0 and 1 (in this order).
  - ti,ssi-cawake-gpio:	Defines which GPIO pin is used to signify CAWAKE
  			events for the port. This is an optional board-specific
  			property. If it's missing the port will not be
  			enabled.

  Optional properties:
  - ti,hwmods:		Shall contain TI interconnect module name if needed
  			by the SoC
