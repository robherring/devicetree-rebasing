  General Purpose Analog To Digital Converter (ADC) based thermal sensor.

  On some of platforms, thermal sensor like thermistors are connected to
  one of ADC channel and sensor resistance is read via voltage across the
  sensor resistor. The voltage read across the sensor is mapped to
  temperature using voltage-temperature lookup table.

  Required properties:
  ===================
  - compatible:		     Must be "generic-adc-thermal".
  - temperature-lookup-table:  Two dimensional array of Integer; lookup table
  			     to map the relation between ADC value and
  			     temperature. When ADC is read, the value is
  			     looked up on the table to get the equivalent
  			     temperature.
  			     The first value of the each row of array is the
  			     temperature in milliCelsius and second value of
  			     the each row of array is the ADC read value.
  - #thermal-sensor-cells:     Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description
  			     of this property.
