title: NVIDIA Tegra186 BPMP thermal sensor

maintainers:
  - Mikko Perttunen <mperttunen@nvidia.com>
description: |+
  In Tegra186, the BPMP (Boot and Power Management Processor) implements an
  interface that is used to read system temperatures, including CPU cluster
  and GPU temperatures. This binding describes the thermal sensor that is
  exposed by BPMP.

  The BPMP thermal node must be located directly inside the main BPMP node. See
  ../firmware/nvidia,tegra186-bpmp.txt for details of the BPMP binding.

  This node represents a thermal sensor. See thermal.txt for details of the
  core thermal binding.
