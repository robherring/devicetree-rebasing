title: Thermal driver for MAX77620 Power management IC from Maxim Semiconductor.

maintainers:

description: |+
  Maxim Semiconductor MAX77620 supports alarm interrupts when its
  die temperature crosses 120C and 140C. These threshold temperatures
  are not configurable. Device does not provide the real temperature
  of die other than just indicating whether temperature is above or
  below threshold level.
