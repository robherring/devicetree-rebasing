  * Temperature Monitor (TEMPMON) on Freescale i.MX SoCs

  Required properties:
  - compatible : "fsl,imx6q-tempmon" for i.MX6Q, "fsl,imx6sx-tempmon" for i.MX6SX.
    i.MX6SX has two more IRQs than i.MX6Q, one is IRQ_LOW and the other is IRQ_PANIC,
    when temperature is below than low threshold, IRQ_LOW will be triggered, when temperature
    is higher than panic threshold, system will auto reboot by SRC module.
  - fsl,tempmon : phandle pointer to system controller that contains TEMPMON
    control registers, e.g. ANATOP on imx6q.
  - nvmem-cells: A phandle to the calibration cells provided by ocotp.
  - nvmem-cell-names: Should be "calib", "temp_grade".

  Deprecated properties:
  - fsl,tempmon-data : phandle pointer to fuse controller that contains TEMPMON
    calibration data, e.g. OCOTP on imx6q.  The details about calibration data
    can be found in SoC Reference Manual.

  Direct access to OCOTP via fsl,tempmon-data is incorrect on some newer chips
  because it does not handle OCOTP clock requirements.

  Optional properties:
  - clocks : thermal sensor's clock source.
