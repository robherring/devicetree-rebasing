description: |+
  In the System Control Module, OMAP supplies a voltage reference
  and a temperature sensor feature that are gathered in the band
  gap voltage and temperature sensor (VBGAPTS) module. The band
  gap provides current and voltage reference for its internal
  circuits and other analog IP blocks. The analog-to-digital
  converter (ADC) produces an output value that is proportional
  to the silicon temperature.

  * Texas Instrument OMAP SCM bandgap bindings

  In the System Control Module, OMAP supplies a voltage reference
  and a temperature sensor feature that are gathered in the band
  gap voltage and temperature sensor (VBGAPTS) module. The band
  gap provides current and voltage reference for its internal
  circuits and other analog IP blocks. The analog-to-digital
  converter (ADC) produces an output value that is proportional
  to the silicon temperature.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be:
    - "ti,omap34xx-bandgap" : for OMAP34xx bandgap
    - "ti,omap36xx-bandgap" : for OMAP36xx bandgap
    - "ti,omap4430-bandgap" : for OMAP4430 bandgap
    - "ti,omap4460-bandgap" : for OMAP4460 bandgap
    - "ti,omap4470-bandgap" : for OMAP4470 bandgap
    - "ti,omap5430-bandgap" : for OMAP5430 bandgap
  - interrupts : this entry should indicate which interrupt line
  the talert signal is routed to;
  Specific:
  - gpios : this entry should be used to inform which GPIO
  line the tshut signal is routed to. The informed GPIO will
  be treated as an IRQ;
  - regs : this entry must also be specified and it is specific
  to each bandgap version, because the mapping may change from
  soc to soc, apart of depending on available features.
