title: Binding for the AXS10x reset controller

maintainers:
  - Eugeniy Paltsev <Eugeniy.Paltsev@synopsys.com>
description: |+
  This binding describes the ARC AXS10x boards custom IP-block which allows
  to control reset signals of selected peripherals. For example DW GMAC, etc...
  This block is controlled via memory-mapped register (AKA CREG) which
  represents up-to 32 reset lines.

  As of today only the following lines are used:
   - DW GMAC - line 5

  This binding uses the common reset binding[1].

  [1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt

             

properties:
  compatible: {}
examples:
  - |
    reset: reset-controller@11220 {
      compatible = "snps,axs10x-reset";
      #reset-cells = <1>;
      reg = <0x11220 0x4>;
    };

    Specifying reset lines connected to IP modules:
    ethernet@.... {

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "snps,axs10x-reset".
  - reg: should always contain pair address - length: for creg reset
    bits register.
  - #reset-cells: from common reset binding; Should always be set to 1.
