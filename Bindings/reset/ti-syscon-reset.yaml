description: |+
  Almost all SoCs have hardware modules that require reset control in addition
  to clock and power control for their functionality. The reset control is
  typically provided by means of memory-mapped I/O registers. These registers are
  sometimes a part of a larger register space region implementing various
  functionalities. This register range is best represented as a syscon node to
  allow multiple entities to access their relevant registers in the common
  register space.

  A SysCon Reset Controller node defines a device that uses a syscon node
  and provides reset management functionality for various hardware modules
  present on the SoC.

  SysCon Reset Controller Node
  ============================
  Each of the reset provider/controller nodes should be a child of a syscon
  node and have the following properties.

  SysCon Reset Controller Node
  ============================
  Each of the reset provider/controller nodes should be a child of a syscon
  node and have the following properties.

  Required properties:
  --------------------
   - compatible		: Should be,
  			    "ti,k2e-pscrst"
  			    "ti,k2l-pscrst"
  			    "ti,k2hk-pscrst"
  			    "ti,syscon-reset"
   - #reset-cells		: Should be 1. Please see the reset consumer node below
  			  for usage details
   - ti,reset-bits	: Contains the reset control register information
  			  Should contain 7 cells for each reset exposed to
  			  consumers, defined as:
  			    Cell #1 : offset of the reset assert control
  			              register from the syscon register base
  			    Cell #2 : bit position of the reset in the reset
  			              assert control register
  			    Cell #3 : offset of the reset deassert control
  			              register from the syscon register base
  			    Cell #4 : bit position of the reset in the reset
  			              deassert control register
  			    Cell #5 : offset of the reset status register
  			              from the syscon register base
  			    Cell #6 : bit position of the reset in the
  			              reset status register
  			    Cell #7 : Flags used to control reset behavior,
  			              availible flags defined in the DT include
  			              file <dt-bindings/reset/ti-syscon.h>

  SysCon Reset Consumer Nodes
  ===========================
  Each of the reset consumer nodes should have the following properties,
  in addition to their own properties.

  Required properties:
  --------------------
   - resets	: A phandle to the reset controller node and an index number
  		  to a reset specifier as defined above.

  Please also refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt for
  common reset controller usage by consumers.
