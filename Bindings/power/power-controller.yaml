title: Generic system power control capability

maintainers:
  - Romain Perier <romain.perier@gmail.com>
description: |
  Power-management integrated circuits or miscellaneous hardware components are
  sometimes able to control the system power. The device driver associated with these
  components might need to define this capability, which tells the kernel that
  it can be used to switch off the system. The corresponding device must have the
  standard property "system-power-controller" in its device node. This property
  marks the device as able to control the system power. In order to test if this
  property is found programmatically, use the helper function
  "of_device_is_system_power_controller" from of.h .

  Example:

  act8846: act8846@5 {
  	 compatible = "active-semi,act8846";
  	 system-power-controller;
  }
