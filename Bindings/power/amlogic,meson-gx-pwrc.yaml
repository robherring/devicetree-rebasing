  The Amlogic Meson SoCs embeds an internal Power domain controller.

  VPU Power Domain

  The Video Processing Unit power domain is controlled by this power controller,
  but the domain requires some external resources to meet the correct power

  Amlogic Meson Power Controller
  ==============================

  The Amlogic Meson SoCs embeds an internal Power domain controller.

  VPU Power Domain
  ----------------

  The Video Processing Unit power domain is controlled by this power controller,
  but the domain requires some external resources to meet the correct power
  sequences.
  The bindings must respect the power domain bindings as described in the file
  power_domain.txt

  Device Tree Bindings:
  ---------------------

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "amlogic,meson-gx-pwrc-vpu" for the Meson GX SoCs
  - #power-domain-cells: should be 0
  - amlogic,hhi-sysctrl: phandle to the HHI sysctrl node
  - resets: phandles to the reset lines needed for this power demain sequence
  	as described in ../reset/reset.txt
  - clocks: from common clock binding: handle to VPU and VAPB clocks
  - clock-names: from common clock binding: must contain "vpu", "vapb"
  	corresponding to entry in the clocks property.

  Parent node should have the following properties :
  - compatible: "amlogic,meson-gx-ao-sysctrl", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
  - reg: base address and size of the AO system control register space.
