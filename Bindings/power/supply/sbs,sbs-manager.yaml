  Binding for sbs-manager

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "<vendor>,<part-number>", "sbs,sbs-charger" as fallback. The part
    number compatible string might be used in order to take care of vendor
    specific registers.
  - reg: integer, i2c address of the device. Should be <0xa>.
  Optional properties:
  - gpio-controller: Marks the port as GPIO controller.
    See "gpio-specifier" in .../devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
  - #gpio-cells: Should be <2>. The first cell is the pin number, the second cell
    is used to specify optional parameters:
    See "gpio-specifier" in .../devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.

  From OS view the device is basically an i2c-mux used to communicate with up to
  four smart battery devices at address 0xb. The driver actually implements this
  behaviour. So standard i2c-mux nodes can be used to register up to four slave
  batteries. Channels will be numerated starting from 1 to 4.
