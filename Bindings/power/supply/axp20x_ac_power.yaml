  AXP20X and AXP22X PMICs' AC power supply

  Required Properties:
   - compatible: One of:
  			"x-powers,axp202-ac-power-supply"
  			"x-powers,axp221-ac-power-supply"

  This node is a subnode of the axp20x PMIC.

  The AXP20X can read the current current and voltage supplied by AC by
  reading ADC channels from the AXP20X ADC.

  The AXP22X is only able to tell if an AC power supply is present and
  usable.
