description: |
  The hardware block controls charging for a coincell or capacitor that is
  used to provide power backup for certain features of the power management
  IC (PMIC)

  - compatible:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <string>
  	Definition: must be: "qcom,pm8941-coincell"

  - reg:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <u32>
  	Definition: base address of the coincell charger registers

  - qcom,rset-ohms:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <u32>
  	Definition: resistance (in ohms) for current-limiting resistor
  		must be one of: 800, 1200, 1700, 2100

  - qcom,vset-millivolts:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <u32>
  	Definition: voltage (in millivolts) to apply for charging
  		must be one of: 2500, 3000, 3100, 3200

  - qcom,charger-disable:
  	Usage: optional
  	Value type: <boolean>
  	Definition: defining this property disables charging

  This charger is a sub-node of one of the 8941 PMIC blocks, and is specified
  as a child node in DTS of that node.  See ../mfd/qcom,spmi-pmic.txt and
  ../mfd/qcom-pm8xxx.txt

  Example:

  	pm8941@0 {
  		coincell@2800 {
  			compatible = "qcom,pm8941-coincell";
  			reg = <0x2800>;

  			qcom,rset-ohms = <2100>;
  			qcom,vset-millivolts = <3000>;
  		};
  	};
