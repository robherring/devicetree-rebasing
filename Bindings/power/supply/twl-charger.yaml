title: TWL BCI (Battery Charger Interface)

description: |+
  The battery charger needs to interact with the USB phy in order
  to know when charging is permissible, and when there is a connection
  or disconnection.

  The choice of phy cannot be configured at a hardware level, so there
  is no value in explicit configuration in device-tree.  Rather
  if there is a sibling of the BCI node which is compatible with
  "ti,twl4030-usb", then that is used to determine when and how
  use USB power for charging.

  TWL BCI (Battery Charger Interface)

  The battery charger needs to interact with the USB phy in order
  to know when charging is permissible, and when there is a connection
  or disconnection.

  The choice of phy cannot be configured at a hardware level, so there
  is no value in explicit configuration in device-tree.  Rather
  if there is a sibling of the BCI node which is compatible with
  "ti,twl4030-usb", then that is used to determine when and how
  use USB power for charging.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:
    - "ti,twl4030-bci"
  - interrupts: two interrupt lines from the TWL SIH (secondary
    interrupt handler) - interrupts 9 and 2.

  Optional properties:
  - ti,bb-uvolt: microvolts for charging the backup battery.
  - ti,bb-uamp: microamps for charging the backup battery.
