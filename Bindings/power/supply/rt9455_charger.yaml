  Binding for Richtek rt9455 battery charger

  Required properties:
  - compatible:				it should contain one of the following:
  					"richtek,rt9455".
  - reg:					integer, i2c address of the device.
  - interrupt-parent:			the phandle for the interrupt controller that
  					services interrupts for this device.
  - interrupts:				interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ, it should be
  					configured with IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW flag.
  - richtek,output-charge-current:	integer, output current from the charger to the
  					battery, in uA.
  - richtek,end-of-charge-percentage:	integer, percent of the output charge current.
  					When the current in constant-voltage phase drops
  					below output_charge_current x end-of-charge-percentage,
  					charge is terminated.
  - richtek,battery-regulation-voltage:	integer, maximum battery voltage in uV.
  - richtek,boost-output-voltage:		integer, maximum voltage provided to consumer
  					devices, when the charger is in boost mode, in uV.

  Optional properties:
  - richtek,min-input-voltage-regulation: integer, input voltage level in uV, used to
  					decrease voltage level when the over current
  					of the input power source occurs.
  					This prevents input voltage drop due to insufficient
  					current provided by the power source.
  					Default: 4500000 uV (4.5V)
  - richtek,avg-input-current-regulation: integer, input current value in uA drained by the
  					charger from the power source.
  					Default: 500000 uA (500mA)
