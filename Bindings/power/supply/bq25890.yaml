  Binding for TI bq25890 Li-Ion Charger

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain one of the following:
      * "ti,bq25890"
  - reg: integer, i2c address of the device.
  - ti,battery-regulation-voltage: integer, maximum charging voltage (in uV);
  - ti,charge-current: integer, maximum charging current (in uA);
  - ti,termination-current: integer, charge will be terminated when current in
      constant-voltage phase drops below this value (in uA);
  - ti,precharge-current: integer, maximum charge current during precharge
      phase (in uA);
  - ti,minimum-sys-voltage: integer, when battery is charging and it is below
      minimum system voltage, the system will be regulated above
      minimum-sys-voltage setting (in uV);
  - ti,boost-voltage: integer, VBUS voltage level in boost mode (in uV);
  - ti,boost-max-current: integer, maximum allowed current draw in boost mode
      (in uA).

  Optional properties:
  - ti,boost-low-freq: boolean, if present boost mode frequency will be 500kHz,
      otherwise 1.5MHz;
  - ti,use-ilim-pin: boolean, if present the ILIM resistor will be used and the
      input current will be the lower between the resistor setting and the IINLIM
      register setting;
  - ti,thermal-regulation-threshold: integer, temperature above which the charge
      current is lowered, to avoid overheating (in degrees Celsius). If omitted,
      the default setting will be used (120 degrees);
