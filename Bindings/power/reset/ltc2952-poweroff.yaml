  Binding for the LTC2952 PowerPath controller

  This chip is used to externally trigger a system shut down. Once the trigger has
  been sent, the chip's watchdog has to be reset to gracefully shut down.
  A full powerdown can be triggered via the kill signal.

  Required properties:

  - compatible:		Must contain: "lltc,ltc2952"
  - watchdog-gpios:	phandle + gpio-specifier for the GPIO connected to the
  			chip's watchdog line
  - kill-gpios:		phandle + gpio-specifier for the GPIO connected to the
  			chip's kill line

  Optional properties:
  - trigger-gpios:	phandle + gpio-specifier for the GPIO connected to the
  			chip's trigger line. If this property is not set, the
  			trigger function is ignored and the chip is kept alive
  			until an explicit kill signal is received
