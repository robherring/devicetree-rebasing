  Marvell 8897/8997 (sd8897/sd8997) bluetooth devices (SDIO or USB based)
  ------
  The 8997 devices supports multiple interfaces. When used on SDIO interfaces,
  the btmrvl driver is used and when used on USB interface, the btusb driver is
  used.

  Required properties:

    - compatible : should be one of the following:
  	* "marvell,sd8897-bt" (for SDIO)
  	* "marvell,sd8997-bt" (for SDIO)
  	* "usb1286,204e"      (for USB)

  Optional properties:

    - marvell,cal-data: Calibration data downloaded to the device during
  		      initialization. This is an array of 28 values(u8).
  		      This is only applicable to SDIO devices.

    - marvell,wakeup-pin: It represents wakeup pin number of the bluetooth chip.
  		        firmware will use the pin to wakeup host system (u16).
    - marvell,wakeup-gap-ms: wakeup gap represents wakeup latency of the host
  		      platform. The value will be configured to firmware. This
  		      is needed to work chip's sleep feature as expected (u16).
    - interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller
    - interrupt-names: Used only for USB based devices (See below)
    - interrupts : specifies the interrupt pin number to the cpu. For SDIO, the
  		 driver will use the first interrupt specified in the interrupt
  		 array. For USB based devices, the driver will use the interrupt
  		 named "wakeup" from the interrupt-names and interrupt arrays.
  		 The driver will request an irq based on this interrupt number.
  		 During system suspend, the irq will be enabled so that the
  		 bluetooth chip can wakeup host platform under certain
  		 conditions. During system resume, the irq will be disabled
  		 to make sure unnecessary interrupt is not received.
