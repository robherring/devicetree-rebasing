  Generic Bluetooth controller over USB (btusb driver)
  ---------------------------------------------------

  Required properties:

    - compatible : should comply with the format "usbVID,PID" specified in
  		 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/usb-device.txt
  		 At the time of writing, the only OF supported devices
  		 (more may be added later) are:

  		  "usb1286,204e" (Marvell 8997)

  Also, vendors that use btusb may have device additional properties, e.g:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/marvell-bt-8xxx.txt

  Optional properties:

    - interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller
    - interrupt-names: (see below)
    - interrupts : The interrupt specified by the name "wakeup" is the interrupt
  		 that shall be used for out-of-band wake-on-bt. Driver will
  		 request this interrupt for wakeup. During system suspend, the
  		 irq will be enabled so that the bluetooth chip can wakeup host
  		 platform out of band. During system resume, the irq will be
  		 disabled to make sure unnecessary interrupt is not received.
