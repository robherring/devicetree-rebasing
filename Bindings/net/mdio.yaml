  Common MDIO bus properties.

  These are generic properties that can apply to any MDIO bus.

  Optional properties:
  - reset-gpios: One GPIO that control the RESET lines of all PHYs on that MDIO
    bus.
  - reset-delay-us: RESET pulse width in microseconds.

  A list of child nodes, one per device on the bus is expected. These
  should follow the generic phy.txt, or a device specific binding document.

  The 'reset-delay-us' indicates the RESET signal pulse width in microseconds and
  applies to all PHY devices. It must therefore be appropriately determined based
  on all PHY requirements (maximum value of all per-PHY RESET pulse widths).
