  The Ethernet controllers of the Marvel Kirkwood, Dove, Orion5x,

  identical unit that provides an interface with the MDIO bus.
  Additionally, Armada 7k and Armada 8k has a second unit which
  provides an interface with the xMDIO bus. This driver handles
  these interfaces.

  * Marvell MDIO Ethernet Controller interface

  The Ethernet controllers of the Marvel Kirkwood, Dove, Orion5x,
  MV78xx0, Armada 370, Armada XP, Armada 7k and Armada 8k have an
  identical unit that provides an interface with the MDIO bus.
  Additionally, Armada 7k and Armada 8k has a second unit which
  provides an interface with the xMDIO bus. This driver handles
  these interfaces.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "marvell,orion-mdio" or "marvell,xmdio"
  - reg: address and length of the MDIO registers.  When an interrupt is
    not present, the length is the size of the SMI register (4 bytes)
    otherwise it must be 0x84 bytes to cover the interrupt control
    registers.

  Optional properties:
  - interrupts: interrupt line number for the SMI error/done interrupt
  - clocks: phandle for up to three required clocks for the MDIO instance

  The child nodes of the MDIO driver are the individual PHY devices
  connected to this MDIO bus. They must have a "reg" property given the
  PHY address on the MDIO bus.
