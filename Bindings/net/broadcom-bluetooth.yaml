  device the slave device is attached to.

  Required properties:

   - compatible: should contain one of the following:
     * "brcm,bcm43438-bt"

  Optional properties:

   - max-speed: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/slave-device.txt
   - shutdown-gpios: GPIO specifier, used to enable the BT module
   - device-wakeup-gpios: GPIO specifier, used to wakeup the controller
   - host-wakeup-gpios: GPIO specifier, used to wakeup the host processor
   - clocks: clock specifier if external clock provided to the controller
   - clock-names: should be "extclk"
