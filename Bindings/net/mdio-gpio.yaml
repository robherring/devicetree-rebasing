title: MDIO on GPIOs

maintainers:
  - Grant Likely <grant.likely@secretlab.ca>
description: |
  Currently defined compatibles:
  - virtual,gpio-mdio

  MDC and MDIO lines connected to GPIO controllers are listed in the
  gpios property as described in section VIII.1 in the following order:

  MDC, MDIO.

  Note: Each gpio-mdio bus should have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
  node.

  Example:

  aliases {
  	mdio-gpio0 = &mdio0;
  };

  mdio0: mdio {
  	compatible = "virtual,mdio-gpio";
  	#address-cells = <1>;
  	#size-cells = <0>;
  	gpios = <&qe_pio_a 11
  		 &qe_pio_c 6>;
  };
