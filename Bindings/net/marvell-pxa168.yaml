  * Marvell PXA168 Ethernet Controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "marvell,pxa168-eth".
  - reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
  - interrupts: interrupt for the device.
  - clocks: pointer to the clock for the device.

  Optional properties:
  - port-id: Ethernet port number. Should be '0','1' or '2'.
  - #address-cells: must be 1 when using sub-nodes.
  - #size-cells: must be 0 when using sub-nodes.
  - phy-handle: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
  - local-mac-address: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.

  Sub-nodes:
  Each PHY can be represented as a sub-node. This is not mandatory.

  Sub-nodes required properties:
  - reg: the MDIO address of the PHY.
