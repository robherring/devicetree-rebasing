  This network controller consists of two devices: a MAC and an SGMII
  internal PHY.  Each device is represented by a device tree node.  A phandle
  connects the MAC node to its corresponding internal phy node.  Another
  phandle points to the external PHY node.

  Qualcomm Technologies EMAC Gigabit Ethernet Controller

  This network controller consists of two devices: a MAC and an SGMII
  internal PHY.  Each device is represented by a device tree node.  A phandle
  connects the MAC node to its corresponding internal phy node.  Another
  phandle points to the external PHY node.

  Required properties:

  MAC node:
  - compatible : Should be "qcom,fsm9900-emac".
  - reg : Offset and length of the register regions for the device
  - interrupts : Interrupt number used by this controller
  - mac-address : The 6-byte MAC address. If present, it is the default
  	MAC address.
  - internal-phy : phandle to the internal PHY node
  - phy-handle : phandle the the external PHY node

  Internal PHY node:
  - compatible : Should be "qcom,fsm9900-emac-sgmii" or "qcom,qdf2432-emac-sgmii".
  - reg : Offset and length of the register region(s) for the device
  - interrupts : Interrupt number used by this controller

  The external phy child node:
  - reg : The phy address
