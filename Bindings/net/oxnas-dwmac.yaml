description: |
  The device inherits all the properties of the dwmac/stmmac devices
  described in the file stmmac.txt in the current directory with the
  following changes.

  Required properties on all platforms:

  - compatible:	For the OX820 SoC, it should be :
  		- "oxsemi,ox820-dwmac" to select glue
  		- "snps,dwmac-3.512" to select IP version.

  - clocks: Should contain phandles to the following clocks
  - clock-names:	Should contain the following:
  		- "stmmaceth" for the host clock - see stmmac.txt
  		- "gmac" for the peripheral gate clock

  - oxsemi,sys-ctrl: a phandle to the system controller syscon node

  Example :

  etha: ethernet@40400000 {
  	compatible = "oxsemi,ox820-dwmac", "snps,dwmac-3.512";
  	reg = <0x40400000 0x2000>;
  	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
  		     <GIC_SPI 17 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
  	interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq";
  	mac-address = [000000000000]; /* Filled in by U-Boot */
  	phy-mode = "rgmii";

  	clocks = <&stdclk CLK_820_ETHA>, <&gmacclk>;
  	clock-names = "gmac", "stmmaceth";
  	resets = <&reset RESET_MAC>;

  	/* Regmap for sys registers */
  	oxsemi,sys-ctrl = <&sys>;

  };
