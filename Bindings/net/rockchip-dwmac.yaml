  Rockchip SoC RK3288 10/100/1000 Ethernet driver(GMAC)

  The device node has following properties.

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "rockchip,<name>-gamc"
     "rockchip,rk3128-gmac": found on RK312x SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3228-gmac": found on RK322x SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3288-gmac": found on RK3288 SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3328-gmac": found on RK3328 SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3366-gmac": found on RK3366 SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3368-gmac": found on RK3368 SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3399-gmac": found on RK3399 SoCs
     "rockchip,rv1108-gmac": found on RV1108 SoCs
   - reg: addresses and length of the register sets for the device.
   - interrupts: Should contain the GMAC interrupts.
   - interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "macirq".
   - rockchip,grf: phandle to the syscon grf used to control speed and mode.
   - clocks: <&cru SCLK_MAC>: clock selector for main clock, from PLL or PHY.
  	   <&cru SCLK_MAC_PLL>: PLL clock for SCLK_MAC
  	   <&cru SCLK_MAC_RX>: clock gate for RX
  	   <&cru SCLK_MAC_TX>: clock gate for TX
  	   <&cru SCLK_MACREF>: clock gate for RMII referce clock
  	   <&cru SCLK_MACREF_OUT> clock gate for RMII reference clock output
  	   <&cru ACLK_GMAC>: AXI clock gate for GMAC
  	   <&cru PCLK_GMAC>: APB clock gate for GMAC
   - clock-names: One name for each entry in the clocks property.
   - phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
   - pinctrl-names: Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states.
   - pinctrl-0: pin-control mode. can be <&rgmii_pins> or <&rmii_pins>.
   - clock_in_out: For RGMII, it must be "input", means main clock(125MHz)
     is not sourced from SoC's PLL, but input from PHY; For RMII, "input" means
     PHY provides the reference clock(50MHz), "output" means GMAC provides the
     reference clock.
   - snps,reset-gpio       gpio number for phy reset.
   - snps,reset-active-low boolean flag to indicate if phy reset is active low.
   - assigned-clocks: main clock, should be <&cru SCLK_MAC>;
   - assigned-clock-parents = parent of main clock.
     can be <&ext_gmac> or <&cru SCLK_MAC_PLL>.

  Optional properties:
   - tx_delay: Delay value for TXD timing. Range value is 0~0x7F, 0x30 as default.
   - rx_delay: Delay value for RXD timing. Range value is 0~0x7F, 0x10 as default.
   - phy-supply: phandle to a regulator if the PHY needs one
