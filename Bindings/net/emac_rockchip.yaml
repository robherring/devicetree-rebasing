  * ARC EMAC 10/100 Ethernet platform driver for Rockchip RK3036/RK3066/RK3188 SoCs

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "rockchip,<name>-emac"
     "rockchip,rk3036-emac": found on RK3036 SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3066-emac": found on RK3066 SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3188-emac": found on RK3188 SoCs
  - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupts: Should contain the EMAC interrupts
  - rockchip,grf: phandle to the syscon grf used to control speed and mode
    for emac.
  - phy: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
  - phy-mode: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.

  Optional properties:
  - phy-supply: phandle to a regulator if the PHY needs one

  Clock handling:
  - clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: Shall be "hclk" for the host clock needed to calculate and set
    polling period of EMAC and "macref" for the reference clock needed to transfer
    data to and from the phy.

  Child nodes of the driver are the individual PHY devices connected to the
  MDIO bus. They must have a "reg" property given the PHY address on the MDIO bus.
