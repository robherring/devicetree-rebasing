  Texas Instruments High End CAN Controller (HECC)
  ================================================

  This file provides information, what the device node
  for the hecc interface contains.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "ti,am3517-hecc"
  - reg: addresses and lengths of the register spaces for 'hecc', 'hecc-ram'
         and 'mbx'
  - reg-names :"hecc", "hecc-ram", "mbx"
  - interrupts: interrupt mapping for the hecc interrupts sources
  - clocks: clock phandles (see clock bindings for details)

  Optional properties:
  - ti,use-hecc1int: if provided configures HECC to produce all interrupts
