  Renesas R-Car CAN FD controller Device Tree Bindings
  ----------------------------------------------------

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Must contain one or more of the following:
    - "renesas,rcar-gen3-canfd" for R-Car Gen3 compatible controller.
    - "renesas,r8a7795-canfd" for R8A7795 (R-Car H3) compatible controller.
    - "renesas,r8a7796-canfd" for R8A7796 (R-Car M3) compatible controller.

    When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
    SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first, followed by the
    family-specific and/or generic versions.

  - reg: physical base address and size of the R-Car CAN FD register map.
  - interrupts: interrupt specifiers for the Channel & Global interrupts
  - clocks: phandles and clock specifiers for 3 clock inputs.
  - clock-names: 3 clock input name strings: "fck", "canfd", "can_clk".
  - pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.
  - pinctrl-names: must be "default".

  Required child nodes:
  The controller supports two channels and each is represented as a child node.
  The name of the child nodes are "channel0" and "channel1" respectively. Each
  child node supports the "status" property only, which is used to
  enable/disable the respective channel.

  Required properties for "renesas,r8a7795-canfd" and "renesas,r8a7796-canfd"
  compatible:
  In R8A7795 and R8A7796 SoCs, canfd clock is a div6 clock and can be used by both
  CAN and CAN FD controller at the same time. It needs to be scaled to maximum
  frequency if any of these controllers use it. This is done using the below
  properties:

  - assigned-clocks: phandle of canfd clock.
  - assigned-clock-rates: maximum frequency of this clock.

  Optional property:
  The controller can operate in either CAN FD only mode (default) or
  Classical CAN only mode. The mode is global to both the channels. In order to
  enable the later, define the following optional property.
   - renesas,no-can-fd: puts the controller in Classical CAN only mode.
