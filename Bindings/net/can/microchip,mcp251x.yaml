  * Microchip MCP251X stand-alone CAN controller device tree bindings

  Required properties:
   - compatible: Should be one of the following:
     - "microchip,mcp2510" for MCP2510.
     - "microchip,mcp2515" for MCP2515.
   - reg: SPI chip select.
   - clocks: The clock feeding the CAN controller.
   - interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller.
   - interrupts: Should contain IRQ line for the CAN controller.

  Optional properties:
   - vdd-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN controller.
   - xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver.
