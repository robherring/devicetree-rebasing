  CORTINA is a registered trademark of Cortina Systems, Inc.

  The driver supports the Cortina Electronic Dispersion Compensation (EDC)
  devices, equipped with clock and data recovery (CDR) circuits. These
  devices make use of registers that are not compatible with Clause 45 or
  Clause 22, therefore they need to be described using the
  "ethernet-phy-id" compatible.

  Since the driver only implements  polling mode support, interrupts info
  can be skipped.

  Example (CS4340 phy):
  	mdio {
  		cs4340_phy@10 {
  			compatible = "ethernet-phy-id13e5.1002";
  			reg = <0x10>;
  		};
  	};
             

properties:
  compatible: {}

    mdio {
      cs4340_phy@10 {
        compatible = "ethernet-phy-id13e5.1002";
        reg = <0x10>;
      };
