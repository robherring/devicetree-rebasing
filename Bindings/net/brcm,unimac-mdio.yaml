  * Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should one from "brcm,genet-mdio-v1", "brcm,genet-mdio-v2",
    "brcm,genet-mdio-v3", "brcm,genet-mdio-v4", "brcm,genet-mdio-v5" or
    "brcm,unimac-mdio"
  - reg: address and length of the register set for the device, first one is the
    base register, and the second one is optional and for indirect accesses to
    larger than 16-bits MDIO transactions
  - reg-names: name(s) of the register must be "mdio" and optional "mdio_indir_rw"
  - #size-cells: must be 1
  - #address-cells: must be 0

  Optional properties:
  - interrupts: must be one if the interrupt is shared with the Ethernet MAC or
    Ethernet switch this MDIO block is integrated from, or must be two, if there
    are two separate interrupts, first one must be "mdio done" and second must be
    for "mdio error"
  - interrupt-names: must be "mdio_done_error" when there is a share interrupt fed
    to this hardware block, or must be "mdio_done" for the first interrupt and
    "mdio_error" for the second when there are separate interrupts

  Child nodes of this MDIO bus controller node are standard Ethernet PHY device
  nodes as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/phy.txt
