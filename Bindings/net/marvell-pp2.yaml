  * Marvell Armada 375 Ethernet Controller (PPv2.1)
    Marvell Armada 7K/8K Ethernet Controller (PPv2.2)

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be one of:
      "marvell,armada-375-pp2"
      "marvell,armada-7k-pp2"
  - reg: addresses and length of the register sets for the device.
    For "marvell,armada-375-pp2", must contain the following register
    sets:
  	- common controller registers
  	- LMS registers
  	- one register area per Ethernet port
    For "marvell,armada-7k-pp2", must contain the following register
    sets:
  	- packet processor registers
  	- networking interfaces registers

  - clocks: pointers to the reference clocks for this device, consequently:
  	- main controller clock (for both armada-375-pp2 and armada-7k-pp2)
  	- GOP clock (for both armada-375-pp2 and armada-7k-pp2)
  	- MG clock (only for armada-7k-pp2)
  	- AXI clock (only for armada-7k-pp2)
  - clock-names: names of used clocks, must be "pp_clk", "gop_clk", "mg_clk"
    and "axi_clk" (the 2 latter only for armada-7k-pp2).

  The ethernet ports are represented by subnodes. At least one port is
  required.

  Required properties (port):

  - interrupts: interrupt for the port
  - port-id: ID of the port from the MAC point of view
  - gop-port-id: only for marvell,armada-7k-pp2, ID of the port from the
    GOP (Group Of Ports) point of view. This ID is used to index the
    per-port registers in the second register area.
  - phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

  Optional properties (port):

  - marvell,loopback: port is loopback mode
  - phy: a phandle to a phy node defining the PHY address (as the reg
    property, a single integer).
  - interrupt-names: if more than a single interrupt for rx is given, must
                     be the name associated to the interrupts listed. Valid
                     names are: "tx-cpu0", "tx-cpu1", "tx-cpu2", "tx-cpu3",
  		   "rx-shared", "link".
  - marvell,system-controller: a phandle to the system controller.
