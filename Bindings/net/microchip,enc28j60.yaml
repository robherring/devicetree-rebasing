  * Microchip ENC28J60

  This is a standalone 10 MBit ethernet controller with SPI interface.

  For each device connected to a SPI bus, define a child node within
  the SPI master node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "microchip,enc28j60"
  - reg: Specify the SPI chip select the ENC28J60 is wired to
  - interrupt-parent: Specify the phandle of the source interrupt, see interrupt
                      binding documentation for details. Usually this is the GPIO bank
                      the interrupt line is wired to.
  - interrupts: Specify the interrupt index within the interrupt controller (referred
                to above in interrupt-parent) and interrupt type. The ENC28J60 natively
                generates falling edge interrupts, however, additional board logic
                might invert the signal.
  - pinctrl-names: List of assigned state names, see pinctrl binding documentation.
  - pinctrl-0: List of phandles to configure the GPIO pin used as interrupt line,
               see also generic and your platform specific pinctrl binding
               documentation.

  Optional properties:
  - spi-max-frequency: Maximum frequency of the SPI bus when accessing the ENC28J60.
    According to the ENC28J80 datasheet, the chip allows a maximum of 20 MHz, however,
    board designs may need to limit this value.
  - local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory.
