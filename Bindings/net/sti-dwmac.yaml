  STMicroelectronics SoC DWMAC glue layer controller

  This file documents differences between the core properties in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/stmmac.txt
  and what is needed on STi platforms to program the stmmac glue logic.

  The device node has following properties.

  Required properties:
   - compatible	: Can be "st,stih415-dwmac", "st,stih416-dwmac",
     "st,stih407-dwmac", "st,stid127-dwmac".
   - st,syscon : Should be phandle/offset pair. The phandle to the syscon node which
     encompases the glue register, and the offset of the control register.
   - st,gmac_en: this is to enable the gmac into a dedicated sysctl control
     register available on STiH407 SoC.
   - pinctrl-0: pin-control for all the MII mode supported.

  Optional properties:
   - resets : phandle pointing to the system reset controller with correct
     reset line index for ethernet reset.
   - st,ext-phyclk: valid only for RMII where PHY can generate 50MHz clock or
     MAC can generate it.
   - st,tx-retime-src: This specifies which clk is wired up to the mac for
     retimeing tx lines. This is totally board dependent and can take one of the
     posssible values from "txclk", "clk_125" or "clkgen".
     If not passed, the internal clock will be used by default.
   - sti-ethclk: this is the phy clock.
   - sti-clkconf: this is an extra sysconfig register, available in new SoCs,
     to program the clk retiming.
   - st,gmac_en: to enable the GMAC, this only is present in some SoCs; e.g.
     STiH407.
