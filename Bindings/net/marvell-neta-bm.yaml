  * Marvell Armada 380/XP Buffer Manager driver (BM)

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "marvell,armada-380-neta-bm".
  - reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
  - clocks: a pointer to the reference clock for this device.
  - internal-mem: a phandle to BM internal SRAM definition.

  Optional properties (port):

  - pool<0 : 3>,capacity: size of external buffer pointers' ring maintained
    in DRAM. Can be set for each pool (id 0 : 3) separately. The value has
    to be chosen between 128 and 16352 and it also has to be aligned to 32.
    Otherwise the driver would adjust a given number or choose default if
    not set.
  - pool<0 : 3>,pkt-size: maximum size of a packet accepted by a given buffer
    pointers' pool (id 0 : 3). It will be taken into consideration only when pool
    type is 'short'. For 'long' ones it would be overridden by port's MTU.
    If not set a driver will choose a default value.

  In order to see how to hook the BM to a given ethernet port, please
  refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/marvell-armada-370-neta.txt.
