  The Broadcom BCM87XX devices are a family of 10G Ethernet PHYs.  They
  have these bindings in addition to the standard PHY bindings.

  Compatible: Should contain "broadcom,bcm8706" or "broadcom,bcm8727" and
              "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45"

  Optional Properties:

  - broadcom,c45-reg-init : one of more sets of 4 cells.  The first cell
    is the MDIO Manageable Device (MMD) address, the second a register
    address within the MMD, the third cell contains a mask to be ANDed
    with the existing register value, and the fourth cell is ORed with
    he result to yield the new register value.  If the third cell has a
    value of zero, no read of the existing value is performed.
