  This is a special case of a MDIO bus multiplexer.  A memory-mapped device,
  like an FPGA, is used to control which child bus is connected.  The mdio-mux
  node must be a child of the memory-mapped device.  The driver currently only
  supports devices with 8, 16 or 32-bit registers.

  Properties for an MDIO bus multiplexer controlled by a memory-mapped device

  This is a special case of a MDIO bus multiplexer.  A memory-mapped device,
  like an FPGA, is used to control which child bus is connected.  The mdio-mux
  node must be a child of the memory-mapped device.  The driver currently only
  supports devices with 8, 16 or 32-bit registers.

  Required properties in addition to the generic multiplexer properties:

  - compatible : string, must contain "mdio-mux-mmioreg"

  - reg : integer, contains the offset of the register that controls the bus
  	multiplexer.  The size field in the 'reg' property is the size of
  	register, and must therefore be 1, 2, or 4.

  - mux-mask : integer, contains an eight-bit mask that specifies which
  	bits in the register control the actual bus multiplexer.  The
  	'reg' property of each child mdio-mux node must be constrained by
  	this mask.
