  The Ralink frame engine ethernet controller can be found on Ralink and
  Mediatek SoCs (RT288x, RT3x5x, RT366x, RT388x, rt5350, mt7620, mt7621, mt76x8).

  Depending on the SoC, there is a number of ports connected to the CPU port
  directly and/or via a (gigabit-)switch.

  Ralink Frame Engine Ethernet controller
  =======================================

  The Ralink frame engine ethernet controller can be found on Ralink and
  Mediatek SoCs (RT288x, RT3x5x, RT366x, RT388x, rt5350, mt7620, mt7621, mt76x8).

  Depending on the SoC, there is a number of ports connected to the CPU port
  directly and/or via a (gigabit-)switch.

  * Ethernet controller node

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of "ralink,rt2880-eth", "ralink,rt3050-eth",
    "ralink,rt3050-eth", "ralink,rt3883-eth", "ralink,rt5350-eth",
    "mediatek,mt7620-eth", "mediatek,mt7621-eth"
  - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
    that services interrupts for this device
  - interrupts: Should contain the frame engines interrupt
  - resets: Should contain the frame engines resets
  - reset-names: Should contain the reset names "fe". If a switch is present
    "esw" is also required.


  * Ethernet port node

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "ralink,eth-port"
  - reg: The number of the physical port
  - phy-handle: reference to the node describing the phy
