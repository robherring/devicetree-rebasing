  Cortina Systems Gemini Ethernet Controller
  ==========================================

  This ethernet controller is found in the Gemini SoC family:
  StorLink SL3512 and SL3516, also known as Cortina Systems
  CS3512 and CS3516.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "cortina,gemini-ethernet"
  - reg: must contain the global registers and the V-bit and A-bit
    memory areas, in total three register sets.
  - syscon: a phandle to the system controller
  - #address-cells: must be specified, must be <1>
  - #size-cells: must be specified, must be <1>
  - ranges: should be state like this giving a 1:1 address translation
    for the subnodes

  The subnodes represents the two ethernet ports in this device.
  They are not independent of each other since they share resources
  in the parent node, and are thus children.

  Required subnodes:
  - port0: contains the resources for ethernet port 0
  - port1: contains the resources for ethernet port 1

  Required subnode properties:
  - compatible: must be "cortina,gemini-ethernet-port"
  - reg: must contain two register areas: the DMA/TOE memory and
    the GMAC memory area of the port
  - interrupts: should contain the interrupt line of the port.
    this is nominally a level interrupt active high.
  - resets: this must provide an SoC-integrated reset line for
    the port.
  - clocks: this should contain a handle to the PCLK clock for
    clocking the silicon in this port
  - clock-names: must be "PCLK"

  Optional subnode properties:
  - phy-mode: see ethernet.txt
  - phy-handle: see ethernet.txt
