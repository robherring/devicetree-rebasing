  Altera SOCFPGA SoC DWMAC controller

  This is a variant of the dwmac/stmmac driver an inherits all descriptions
  present in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/stmmac.txt.

  The device node has additional properties:

  Required properties:
   - compatible	: Should contain "altr,socfpga-stmmac" along with
  		  "snps,dwmac" and any applicable more detailed
  		  designware version numbers documented in stmmac.txt
   - altr,sysmgr-syscon : Should be the phandle to the system manager node that
     encompasses the glue register, the register offset, and the register shift.
   - altr,f2h_ptp_ref_clk use f2h_ptp_ref_clk instead of default eosc1 clock
     for ptp ref clk. This affects all emacs as the clock is common.

  Optional properties:
  altr,emac-splitter: Should be the phandle to the emac splitter soft IP node if
  		DWMAC controller is connected emac splitter.
  phy-mode: The phy mode the ethernet operates in
  altr,sgmii-to-sgmii-converter: phandle to the TSE SGMII converter

  This device node has additional phandle dependency, the sgmii converter:

  Required properties:
   - compatible	: Should be altr,gmii-to-sgmii-2.0
   - reg-names	: Should be "eth_tse_control_port"
