  * Marvell Armada 370 / Armada XP / Armada 3700 Ethernet Controller (NETA)

  Required properties:
  - compatible: could be one of the following:
  	"marvell,armada-370-neta"
  	"marvell,armada-xp-neta"
  	"marvell,armada-3700-neta"
  - reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
  - interrupts: interrupt for the device
  - phy: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
  - phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
  - clocks: List of clocks for this device. At least one clock is
    mandatory for the core clock. If several clocks are given, then the
    clock-names property must be used to identify them.

  Optional properties:
  - tx-csum-limit: maximum mtu supported by port that allow TX checksum.
    Value is presented in bytes. If not used, by default 1600B is set for
    "marvell,armada-370-neta" and 9800B for others.
  - clock-names: List of names corresponding to clocks property; shall be
    "core" for core clock and "bus" for the optional bus clock.


  Optional properties (valid only for Armada XP/38x):

  - buffer-manager: a phandle to a buffer manager node. Please refer to
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/marvell-neta-bm.txt
  - bm,pool-long: ID of a pool, that will accept all packets of a size
    higher than 'short' pool's threshold (if set) and up to MTU value.
    Obligatory, when the port is supposed to use hardware
    buffer management.
  - bm,pool-short: ID of a pool, that will be used for accepting
    packets of a size lower than given threshold. If not set, the port
    will use a single 'long' pool for all packets, as defined above.
