  MediaTek Frame Engine Ethernet controller
  =========================================

  The frame engine ethernet controller can be found on MediaTek SoCs. These SoCs
  have dual GMAC each represented by a child node..

  * Ethernet controller node

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be
  		"mediatek,mt2701-eth": for MT2701 SoC
  		"mediatek,mt7623-eth", "mediatek,mt2701-eth": for MT7623 SoC
  		"mediatek,mt7622-eth": for MT7622 SoC
  - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupts: Should contain the three frame engines interrupts in numeric
  	order. These are fe_int0, fe_int1 and fe_int2.
  - clocks: the clock used by the core
  - clock-names: the names of the clock listed in the clocks property. These are
  	"ethif", "esw", "gp2", "gp1" : For MT2701 and MT7623 SoC
          "ethif", "esw", "gp0", "gp1", "gp2", "sgmii_tx250m", "sgmii_rx250m",
  	"sgmii_cdr_ref", "sgmii_cdr_fb", "sgmii_ck", "eth2pll" : For MT7622 SoC
  - power-domains: phandle to the power domain that the ethernet is part of
  - resets: Should contain phandles to the ethsys reset signals
  - reset-names: Should contain the names of reset signal listed in the resets
  		property
  		These are "fe", "gmac" and "ppe"
  - mediatek,ethsys: phandle to the syscon node that handles the port setup
  - mediatek,sgmiisys: phandle to the syscon node that handles the SGMII setup
  	which is required for those SoCs equipped with SGMII such as MT7622 SoC.
  - mediatek,pctl: phandle to the syscon node that handles the ports slew rate
  	and driver current: only for MT2701 and MT7623 SoC

  Optional properties:
  - interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
    that services interrupts for this device
  * Ethernet MAC node

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "mediatek,eth-mac"
  - reg: The number of the MAC
  - phy-handle: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory and
  	the phy-mode "trgmii" required being provided when reg
  	is equal to 0 and the MAC uses fixed-link to connect
  	with internal switch such as MT7530.
