  Hisilicon MDIO bus controller

  Properties:
  - compatible: can be one of:
  	"hisilicon,hns-mdio"
  	"hisilicon,mdio"
    "hisilicon,hns-mdio" is recommended to be used for hip05 and later SOCs,
    while "hisilicon,mdio" is optional for backwards compatibility only on
    hip04 Soc.
  - reg: The base address of the MDIO bus controller register bank.
  - #address-cells: Must be <1>.
  - #size-cells: Must be <0>.  MDIO addresses have no size component.

  Typically an MDIO bus might have several children.
