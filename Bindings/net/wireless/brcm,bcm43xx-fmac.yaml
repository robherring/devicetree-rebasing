  Broadcom BCM43xx Fullmac wireless SDIO devices

  This node provides properties for controlling the Broadcom wireless device. The
  node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO controller that
  connects the device to the system.

  Required properties:

   - compatible : Should be "brcm,bcm4329-fmac".

  Optional properties:
   - brcm,drive-strength : drive strength used for SDIO pins on device in mA
  	(default = 6).
   - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
  	device interrupts are connected.
   - interrupts : specifies attributes for the out-of-band interrupt (host-wake).
  	When not specified the device will use in-band SDIO interrupts.
   - interrupt-names : name of the out-of-band interrupt, which must be set
  	to "host-wake".
