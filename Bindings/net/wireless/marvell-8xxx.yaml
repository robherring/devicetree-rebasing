  Marvell 8787/8897/8997 (sd8787/sd8897/sd8997/pcie8997) SDIO/PCIE devices
  ------

  This node provides properties for controlling the Marvell SDIO/PCIE wireless device.
  The node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO/PCIE controller that
  connects the device to the system.

  Required properties:

    - compatible : should be one of the following:
  	* "marvell,sd8787"
  	* "marvell,sd8897"
  	* "marvell,sd8997"
  	* "pci11ab,2b42"
  	* "pci1b4b,2b42"

  Optional properties:

    - marvell,caldata* : A series of properties with marvell,caldata prefix,
  		      represent calibration data downloaded to the device during
  		      initialization. This is an array of unsigned 8-bit values.
  		      the properties should follow below property name and
  		      corresponding array length:
  	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-2g" (length = 566).
  	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub0" (length = 502).
  	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub1" (length = 688).
  	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub2" (length = 750).
  	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub3" (length = 502).
    - marvell,wakeup-pin : a wakeup pin number of wifi chip which will be configured
  		      to firmware. Firmware will wakeup the host using this pin
  		      during suspend/resume.
    - interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller
    - interrupts : interrupt pin number to the cpu. driver will request an irq based on
  		 this interrupt number. during system suspend, the irq will be enabled
  		 so that the wifi chip can wakeup host platform under certain condition.
  		 during system resume, the irq will be disabled to make sure
  		 unnecessary interrupt is not received.
    - vmmc-supply: a phandle of a regulator, supplying VCC to the card
    - mmc-pwrseq:  phandle to the MMC power sequence node. See "mmc-pwrseq-*"
  		 for documentation of MMC power sequence bindings.
