  * Qualcomm Atheros ath10k wireless devices

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of the following:
  	* "qcom,ath10k"
  	* "qcom,ipq4019-wifi"

  PCI based devices uses compatible string "qcom,ath10k" and takes calibration
  data along with board specific data via "qcom,ath10k-calibration-data".
  Rest of the properties are not applicable for PCI based devices.

  AHB based devices (i.e. ipq4019) uses compatible string "qcom,ipq4019-wifi"
  and also uses most of the properties defined in this doc (except
  "qcom,ath10k-calibration-data"). It uses "qcom,ath10k-pre-calibration-data"
  to carry pre calibration data.

  In general, entry "qcom,ath10k-pre-calibration-data" and
  "qcom,ath10k-calibration-data" conflict with each other and only one
  can be provided per device.

  Optional properties:
  - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.
  - resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
            See ../reset/reseti.txt for details.
  - reset-names: Must include the list of following reset names,
  	       "wifi_cpu_init"
  	       "wifi_radio_srif"
  	       "wifi_radio_warm"
  	       "wifi_radio_cold"
  	       "wifi_core_warm"
  	       "wifi_core_cold"
  - clocks: List of clock specifiers, must contain an entry for each required
            entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: Should contain the clock names "wifi_wcss_cmd", "wifi_wcss_ref",
                 "wifi_wcss_rtc".
  - interrupts: List of interrupt lines. Must contain an entry
  	      for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
  - interrupt-names: Must include the entries for MSI interrupt
  		   names ("msi0" to "msi15") and legacy interrupt
  		   name ("legacy"),
  - qcom,msi_addr: MSI interrupt address.
  - qcom,msi_base: Base value to add before writing MSI data into
  		MSI address register.
  - qcom,ath10k-calibration-variant: string to search for in the board-2.bin
  				   variant list with the same bus and device
  				   specific ids
  - qcom,ath10k-calibration-data : calibration data + board specific data
  				 as an array, the length can vary between
  				 hw versions.
  - qcom,ath10k-pre-calibration-data : pre calibration data as an array,
  				     the length can vary between hw versions.
