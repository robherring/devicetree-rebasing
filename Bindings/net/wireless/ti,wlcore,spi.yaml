  * Texas Instruments wl12xx/wl18xx wireless lan controller

  The wl12xx/wl18xx chips can be connected via SPI or via SDIO. This
  document describes the binding for the SPI connected chip.

  Required properties:
  - compatible :          Should be one of the following:
      * "ti,wl1271"
      * "ti,wl1273"
      * "ti,wl1281"
      * "ti,wl1283"
      * "ti,wl1801"
      * "ti,wl1805"
      * "ti,wl1807"
      * "ti,wl1831"
      * "ti,wl1835"
      * "ti,wl1837"
  - reg :                 Chip select address of device
  - spi-max-frequency :   Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz
  - interrupt-parent, interrupts :
                          Should contain parameters for 1 interrupt line.
                          Interrupt parameters: parent, line number, type.
  - vwlan-supply :        Point the node of the regulator that powers/enable the
                          wl12xx/wl18xx chip

  Optional properties:
  - ref-clock-frequency : Reference clock frequency (should be set for wl12xx)
  - clock-xtal :          boolean, clock is generated from XTAL

  - Please consult Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
    for optional SPI connection related properties,
