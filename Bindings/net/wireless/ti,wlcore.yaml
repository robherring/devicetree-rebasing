  TI Wilink 6/7/8 (wl12xx/wl18xx) SDIO devices

  This node provides properties for controlling the wilink wireless device. The
  node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO controller that
  connects the device to the system.

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be one of the following:
      * "ti,wl1271"
      * "ti,wl1273"
      * "ti,wl1281"
      * "ti,wl1283"
      * "ti,wl1285"
      * "ti,wl1801"
      * "ti,wl1805"
      * "ti,wl1807"
      * "ti,wl1831"
      * "ti,wl1835"
      * "ti,wl1837"
   - interrupts : specifies attributes for the out-of-band interrupt.

  Optional properties:
   - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
  	device interrupts are connected.
   - ref-clock-frequency : ref clock frequency in Hz
   - tcxo-clock-frequency : tcxo clock frequency in Hz

  Note: the *-clock-frequency properties assume internal clocks. In case of external
  clock, new bindings (for parsing the clock nodes) have to be added.
