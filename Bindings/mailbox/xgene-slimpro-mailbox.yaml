  The APM X-Gene SLIMpro mailbox is used to communicate messages between
  the ARM64 processors and the Cortex M3 (dubbed SLIMpro). It uses a simple
  interrupt based door bell mechanism and can exchange simple messages using the
  internal registers.

  There are total of 8 interrupts in this mailbox. Each used for an individual
  door bell (or mailbox channel).

  Required properties:
  - compatible:	Should be as "apm,xgene-slimpro-mbox".

  - reg:		Contains the mailbox register address range.

  - interrupts:	8 interrupts must be from 0 to 7, interrupt 0 define the
  		the interrupt for mailbox channel 0 and interrupt 1 for
  		mailbox channel 1 and so likewise for the reminder.

  - #mbox-cells:	only one to specify the mailbox channel number.
