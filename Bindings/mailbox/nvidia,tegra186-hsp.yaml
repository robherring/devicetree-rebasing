title: NVIDIA Tegra Hardware Synchronization Primitives (HSP)

description: |+
  The HSP modules are used for the processors to share resources and communicate
  together. It provides a set of hardware synchronization primitives for
  interprocessor communication. So the interprocessor communication (IPC)
  protocols can use hardware synchronization primitives, when operating between
  two processors not in an SMP relationship.

  The features that HSP supported are shared mailboxes, shared semaphores,
  arbitrated semaphores and doorbells.

  NVIDIA Tegra Hardware Synchronization Primitives (HSP)

  The HSP modules are used for the processors to share resources and communicate
  together. It provides a set of hardware synchronization primitives for
  interprocessor communication. So the interprocessor communication (IPC)
  protocols can use hardware synchronization primitives, when operating between
  two processors not in an SMP relationship.

  The features that HSP supported are shared mailboxes, shared semaphores,
  arbitrated semaphores and doorbells.

  Required properties:
  - name : Should be hsp
  - compatible
      Array of strings.
      one of:
      - "nvidia,tegra186-hsp"
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
  - interrupt-names
      Array of strings.
      Contains a list of names for the interrupts described by the interrupt
      property. May contain the following entries, in any order:
      - "doorbell"
      Users of this binding MUST look up entries in the interrupt property
      by name, using this interrupt-names property to do so.
  - interrupts
      Array of interrupt specifiers.
      Must contain one entry per entry in the interrupt-names property,
      in a matching order.
  - #mbox-cells : Should be 2.

  The mbox specifier of the "mboxes" property in the client node should
  contain two data. The first one should be the HSP type and the second
  one should be the ID that the client is going to use. Those information
  can be found in the following file.

  - <dt-bindings/mailbox/tegra186-hsp.h>.
