title: Amlogic Meson MHU Mailbox Driver

description: |+
  The Amlogic's Meson SoCs Message-Handling-Unit (MHU) is a mailbox controller
  that has 3 independent channels/links to communicate with remote processor(s).
  MHU links are hardwired on a platform. A link raises interrupt for any
  received data. However, there is no specified way of knowing if the sent
  data has been read by the remote. This driver assumes the sender polls
  STAT register and the remote clears it after having read the data.
