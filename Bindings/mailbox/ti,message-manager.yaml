description: |
  The Texas Instruments' Message Manager is a mailbox controller that has
  configurable queues selectable at SoC(System on Chip) integration. The Message
  manager is broken up into queues in different address regions that are called
  "proxies" - each instance is unidirectional and is instantiated at SoC
  integration level to indicate receive or transmit path.

  Texas Instruments' Message Manager Driver
  ========================================

  The Texas Instruments' Message Manager is a mailbox controller that has
  configurable queues selectable at SoC(System on Chip) integration. The Message
  manager is broken up into queues in different address regions that are called
  "proxies" - each instance is unidirectional and is instantiated at SoC

  Message Manager Device Node:
  ===========================
  Required properties:
  --------------------
  - compatible:		Shall be: "ti,k2g-message-manager"
  - reg-names 		queue_proxy_region - Map the queue proxy region.
  			queue_state_debug_region - Map the queue state debug
  			region.
  - reg:			Contains the register map per reg-names.
  - #mbox-cells		Shall be 2. Contains the queue ID and proxy ID in that
  		        order referring to the transfer path.
  - interrupt-names:	Contains interrupt names matching the rx transfer path
  			for a given SoC. Receive interrupts shall be of the
  			format: "rx_<QID>".
  			For ti,k2g-message-manager, this shall contain:
  				"rx_005", "rx_057"
  - interrupts:		Contains the interrupt information corresponding to
  			interrupt-names property.
