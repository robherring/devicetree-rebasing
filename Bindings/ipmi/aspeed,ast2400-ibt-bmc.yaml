  * Aspeed BT (Block Transfer) IPMI interface

  The Aspeed SOCs (AST2400 and AST2500) are commonly used as BMCs
  (BaseBoard Management Controllers) and the BT interface can be used to
  perform in-band IPMI communication with their host.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be one of
  	"aspeed,ast2400-ibt-bmc"
  	"aspeed,ast2500-ibt-bmc"
  - reg: physical address and size of the registers

  Optional properties:

  - interrupts: interrupt generated by the BT interface. without an
    interrupt, the driver will operate in poll mode.
