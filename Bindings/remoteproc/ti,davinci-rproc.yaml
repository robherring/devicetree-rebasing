description: |+
  Binding status: Unstable - Subject to changes for DT representation of clocks
  			   and resets

  The TI Davinci family of SoCs usually contains a TI DSP Core sub-system that
  is used to offload some of the processor-intensive tasks or algorithms, for
  achieving various system level goals.

  The processor cores in the sub-system usually contain additional sub-modules
  like L1 and/or L2 caches/SRAMs, an Interrupt Controller, an external memory
  controller, a dedicated local power/sleep controller etc. The DSP processor
  core used in Davinci SoCs is usually a C674x DSP CPU.

  DSP Device Node:
  ================
  Each DSP Core sub-system is represented as a single DT node.

  Required properties:
  --------------------
  The following are the mandatory properties:

  - compatible:		Should be one of the following,
  			    "ti,da850-dsp" for DSPs on OMAP-L138 SoCs

  - reg:			Should contain an entry for each value in 'reg-names'.
  			Each entry should have the memory region's start address
  			and the size of the region, the representation matching
  			the parent node's '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' values.

  - reg-names:		Should contain strings with the following names, each
  			representing a specific internal memory region or a
  			specific register space,
  			     "l2sram", "l1pram", "l1dram", "host1cfg", "chipsig_base"

  - interrupts: 		Should contain the interrupt number used to receive the
  			interrupts from the DSP. The value should follow the
  			interrupt-specifier format as dictated by the
  			'interrupt-parent' node.

  - memory-region:	phandle to the reserved memory node to be associated
  			with the remoteproc device. The reserved memory node
  			can be a CMA memory node, and should be defined as
  			per the bindings in
  			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt

  Optional properties:
  --------------------
  - interrupt-parent:	phandle to the interrupt controller node. This property
  			is needed if the device node hierarchy doesn't have an
  			interrupt controller.
