title: TI Wakeup M3 Remoteproc Driver

maintainers:
  - Dave Gerlach <d-gerlach@ti.com>
description: |+
  The TI AM33xx and AM43xx family of devices use a small Cortex M3 co-processor
  (commonly referred to as Wakeup M3 or CM3) to help with various low power tasks
  that cannot be controlled from the MPU. This CM3 processor requires a firmware
  binary to accomplish this. The wkup_m3 remoteproc driver handles the loading of
  the firmware and booting of the CM3.

  Wkup M3 Device Node:
  ====================
  A wkup_m3 device node is used to represent the Wakeup M3 processor instance
  within the SoC. It is added as a child node of the parent interconnect bus
  (l4_wkup) through which it is accessible to the MPU.

  Required properties:
  --------------------
  - compatible:		Should be one of,
  				"ti,am3352-wkup-m3" for AM33xx SoCs
  				"ti,am4372-wkup-m3" for AM43xx SoCs
  - reg:			Should contain the address ranges for the two internal
  			memory regions, UMEM and DMEM. The parent node should
  			provide an appropriate ranges property for properly
  			translating these into bus addresses.
  - reg-names:		Contains the corresponding names for the two memory
  			regions. These should be named "umem" & "dmem".
  - ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated with the wkupm3 device.
  - ti,pm-firmware:	Name of firmware file to be used for loading and
  			booting the wkup_m3 remote processor.
