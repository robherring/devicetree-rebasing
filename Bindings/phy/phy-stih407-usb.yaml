  ST STiH407 USB PHY controller

  This file documents the dt bindings for the usb picoPHY driver which is the PHY for both USB2 and USB3
  host controllers (when controlling usb2/1.1 devices) available on STiH407 SoC family from STMicroelectronics.

  Required properties:
  - compatible		: should be "st,stih407-usb2-phy"
  - st,syscfg		: phandle of sysconfig bank plus integer array containing phyparam and phyctrl register offsets
  - resets		: list of phandle and reset specifier pairs. There should be two entries, one
  			  for the whole phy and one for the port
  - reset-names		: list of reset signal names. Should be "global" and "port"
