  Rockchip EMMC PHY
  -----------------------

  Required properties:
   - compatible: rockchip,rk3399-emmc-phy
   - #phy-cells: must be 0
   - reg: PHY register address offset and length in "general
     register files"

  Optional clocks using the clock bindings (see ../clock/clock-bindings.txt),
  specified by name:
   - clock-names: Should contain "emmcclk".  Although this is listed as optional
  		(because most boards can get basic functionality without having
  		access to it), it is strongly suggested.
   - clocks: Should have a phandle to the card clock exported by the SDHCI driver.
