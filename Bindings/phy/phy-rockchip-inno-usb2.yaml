  ROCKCHIP USB2.0 PHY WITH INNO IP BLOCK

  Required properties (phy (parent) node):
   - compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles:
  	* "rockchip,rk3228-usb2phy"
  	* "rockchip,rk3328-usb2phy"
  	* "rockchip,rk3366-usb2phy"
  	* "rockchip,rk3399-usb2phy"
  	* "rockchip,rv1108-usb2phy"
   - reg : the address offset of grf for usb-phy configuration.
   - #clock-cells : should be 0.
   - clock-output-names : specify the 480m output clock name.

  Optional properties:
   - clocks : phandle + phy specifier pair, for the input clock of phy.
   - clock-names : input clock name of phy, must be "phyclk".
   - assigned-clocks : phandle of usb 480m clock.
   - assigned-clock-parents : parent of usb 480m clock, select between
  		 usb-phy output 480m and xin24m.
  		 Refer to clk/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock
  		 consumer properties.
   - rockchip,usbgrf : phandle to the syscon managing the "usb general
  		 register files". When set driver will request its
  		 phandle as one companion-grf for some special SoCs
  		 (e.g RV1108).

  Required nodes : a sub-node is required for each port the phy provides.
  		 The sub-node name is used to identify host or otg port,
  		 and shall be the following entries:
  	* "otg-port" : the name of otg port.
  	* "host-port" : the name of host port.

  Required properties (port (child) node):
   - #phy-cells : must be 0. See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
   - interrupts : specify an interrupt for each entry in interrupt-names.
   - interrupt-names : a list which should be one of the following cases:
  	Regular case:
  	* "otg-id" : for the otg id interrupt.
  	* "otg-bvalid" : for the otg vbus interrupt.
  	* "linestate" : for the host/otg linestate interrupt.
  	Some SoCs use one interrupt with the above muxed together, so for these
  	* "otg-mux" : otg-port interrupt, which mux otg-id/otg-bvalid/linestate
  		to one.

  Optional properties:
   - phy-supply : phandle to a regulator that provides power to VBUS.
  		See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
