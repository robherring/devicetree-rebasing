  Qualcomm APQ8064 SATA PHY Controller
  ------------------------------------

  SATA PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip SATA Physical layer controllers.
  Each SATA PHY controller should have its own node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: compatible list, contains "qcom,apq8064-sata-phy".
  - reg: offset and length of the SATA PHY register set;
  - #phy-cells: must be zero
  - clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry in
    clock-names.
  - clock-names: must be "cfg" for phy config clock.
