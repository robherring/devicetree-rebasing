  mvebu comphy driver
  -------------------

  A comphy controller can be found on Marvell Armada 7k/8k on the CP110. It
  provides a number of shared PHYs used by various interfaces (network, sata,
  usb, PCIe...).

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "marvell,comphy-cp110"
  - reg: should contain the comphy register location and length.
  - marvell,system-controller: should contain a phandle to the
                               system controller node.
  - #address-cells: should be 1.
  - #size-cells: should be 0.

  A sub-node is required for each comphy lane provided by the comphy.

  Required properties (child nodes):

  - reg: comphy lane number.
  - #phy-cells : from the generic phy bindings, must be 1. Defines the
                 input port to use for a given comphy lane.
