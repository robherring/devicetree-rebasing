  TI Keystone USB PHY

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "ti,keystone-usbphy".
   - #address-cells, #size-cells : should be '1' if the device has sub-nodes
     with 'reg' property.
   - reg : Address and length of the usb phy control register set.

  The main purpose of this PHY driver is to enable the USB PHY reference clock
  gate on the Keystone SOC for both the USB2 and USB3 PHY. Otherwise it is just
  an NOP PHY driver.  Hence this node is referenced as both the usb2 and usb3
  phy node in the USB Glue layer driver node.

  usb_phy: usb_phy@2620738 {
  	compatible = "ti,keystone-usbphy";
  	#address-cells = <1>;
  	#size-cells = <1>;
  	reg = <0x2620738 32>;
  };
