  	registers used for general control of the PHY.
  	The second pair specifies optional registers used by some of
  	the SoCs that support USB 3.x
   - #phy-cells: Shall be 1 as it expects one argument for setting
  	       the type of the PHY. Possible values are:
  	       - PHY_TYPE_USB2 for USB1.1/2.0 PHY
  	       - PHY_TYPE_USB3 for USB3.x PHY

  Optional Properties:
  - clocks : clock phandles.
  - clock-names: String, clock name.
  - brcm,ipp: Boolean, Invert Port Power.
    Possible values are: 0 (Don't invert), 1 (Invert)

    Possible values are: 0 (Don't invert), 1 (Invert)
  NOTE: one or both of the following two properties must be set
  - brcm,has-xhci: Boolean indicating the phy has an XHCI phy.
  - brcm,has-eohci: Boolean indicating the phy has an EHCI/OHCI phy.
  - dr_mode: String, PHY Device mode.
