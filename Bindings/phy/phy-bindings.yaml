  This document explains only the device tree data binding. For general
  information about PHY subsystem refer to Documentation/phy.txt

  PHY device node
  ===============

  Required Properties:
  #phy-cells:	Number of cells in a PHY specifier;  The meaning of all those
  		cells is defined by the binding for the phy node. The PHY
  		provider can use the values in cells to find the appropriate
  		PHY.

  Optional Properties:
  phy-supply:	Phandle to a regulator that provides power to the PHY. This
  		regulator will be managed during the PHY power on/off sequence.

  For example:

  phys: phy {
      compatible = "xxx";
      reg = <...>;
      .
      .
      #phy-cells = <1>;
      .
      .
  };

  That node describes an IP block (PHY provider) that implements 2 different PHYs.
  In order to differentiate between these 2 PHYs, an additional specifier should be
  given while trying to get a reference to it.

  PHY user node
  =============

  Required Properties:
  phys : the phandle for the PHY device (used by the PHY subsystem; not to be
         confused with the Ethernet specific 'phy' and 'phy-handle' properties,
         see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet.txt for these)
  phy-names : the names of the PHY corresponding to the PHYs present in the
  	    *phys* phandle
