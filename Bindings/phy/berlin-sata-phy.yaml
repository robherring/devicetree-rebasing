  Berlin SATA PHY
  ---------------

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be one of
      "marvell,berlin2-sata-phy"
      "marvell,berlin2q-sata-phy"
  - address-cells: should be 1
  - size-cells: should be 0
  - phy-cells: from the generic PHY bindings, must be 1
  - reg: address and length of the register
  - clocks: reference to the clock entry

  Sub-nodes:
  Each PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

  Sub-nodes required properties:
  - reg: the PHY number
