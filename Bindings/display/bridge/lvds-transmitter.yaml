title: Parallel to LVDS Encoder

maintainers:

description: |+
  This binding supports the parallel to LVDS encoders that don't require any
  configuration.

  LVDS is a physical layer specification defined in ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A. Multiple
  incompatible data link layers have been used over time to transmit image data
  to LVDS panels. This binding targets devices compatible with the following
  specifications only.

  [JEIDA] "Digital Interface Standards for Monitor", JEIDA-59-1999, February
  1999 (Version 1.0), Japan Electronic Industry Development Association (JEIDA)
  [LDI] "Open LVDS Display Interface", May 1999 (Version 0.95), National
  Semiconductor
  [VESA] "VESA Notebook Panel Standard", October 2007 (Version 1.0), Video
  Electronics Standards Association (VESA)

  Those devices have been marketed under the FPD-Link and FlatLink brand names
  among others.
