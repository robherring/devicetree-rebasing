  The video processing pipeline on the second output on the GE B850v3:

     Host -> LVDS|--(STDP4028)--|DP -> DP|--(STDP2690)--|DP++ -> Video output

  Each bridge has a dedicated flash containing firmware for supporting the custom
  design. The result is that, in this design, neither the STDP4028 nor the
  STDP2690 behave as the stock bridges would. The compatible strings include the
  suffix "-ge-b850v3-fw" to make it clear that the driver is for the bridges with
  the firmware specific for the GE B850v3.

  The hardware do not provide control over the video processing pipeline, as the
  two bridges behaves as a single one. The only interfaces exposed by the
  hardware are EDID, HPD, and interrupts.

  stdp4028-ge-b850v3-fw required properties:
    - compatible : "megachips,stdp4028-ge-b850v3-fw"
    - reg : I2C bus address
    - interrupt-parent : phandle of the interrupt controller that services
      interrupts to the device
    - interrupts : one interrupt should be described here, as in
      <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>
    - ports : One input port(reg = <0>) and one output port(reg = <1>)
