  Device-Tree bindings for the NXP TDA998x HDMI transmitter

  Required properties;
    - compatible: must be "nxp,tda998x"

    - reg: I2C address

  Required node:
    - port: Input port node with endpoint definition, as described
          in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt

  Optional properties:
    - interrupts: interrupt number and trigger type
  	default: polling

    - pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for
  	screen plug/unplug interrupt.

    - pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.

    - video-ports: 24 bits value which defines how the video controller
  	output is wired to the TDA998x input - default: <0x230145>

    - audio-ports: array of 8-bit values, 2 values per one DAI[1].
  	The first value defines the DAI type: TDA998x_SPDIF or TDA998x_I2S[2].
  	The second value defines the tda998x AP_ENA reg content when the DAI
  	in question is used. The implementation allows one or two DAIs. If two
  	DAIs are defined, they must be of different type.
