  Sitronix ST7789V RGB panel with SPI control bus

  Required properties:
    - compatible: "sitronix,st7789v"
    - reg: Chip select of the panel on the SPI bus
    - reset-gpios: a GPIO phandle for the reset pin
    - power-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage

  Optional properties:
    - backlight: phandle to the backlight used

  The generic bindings for the SPI slaves documented in [1] also applies

  The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
  'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in [2]. This
  node should describe panel's video bus.
