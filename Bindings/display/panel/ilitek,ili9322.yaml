description: |+
  This is a driver for 320x240 TFT panels, accepting a variety of input
  streams that get adapted and scaled to the panel. The panel output has
  960 TFT source driver pins and 240 TFT gate driver pins, VCOM, VCOML and
  VCOMH outputs.

  Ilitek ILI9322 TFT panel driver with SPI control bus

  This is a driver for 320x240 TFT panels, accepting a variety of input
  streams that get adapted and scaled to the panel. The panel output has
  960 TFT source driver pins and 240 TFT gate driver pins, VCOM, VCOML and
  VCOMH outputs.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: "dlink,dir-685-panel", "ilitek,ili9322"
      (full system-specific compatible is always required to look up configuration)
    - reg: address of the panel on the SPI bus

  Optional properties:
    - vcc-supply: core voltage supply, see regulator/regulator.txt
    - iovcc-supply: voltage supply for the interface input/output signals,
      see regulator/regulator.txt
    - vci-supply: voltage supply for analog parts, see regulator/regulator.txt
    - reset-gpios: a GPIO spec for the reset pin, see gpio/gpio.txt

    The following optional properties only apply to RGB and YUV input modes and
    can be omitted for BT.656 input modes:

    - pixelclk-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt
    - de-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt
    - hsync-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt
    - vsync-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt

  The panel must obey the rules for a SPI slave device as specified in
  spi/spi-bus.txt

  The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
  'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in
  media/video-interfaces.txt. This node should describe panel's video bus.
