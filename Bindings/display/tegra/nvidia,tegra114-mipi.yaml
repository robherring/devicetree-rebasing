  NVIDIA Tegra MIPI pad calibration controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "nvidia,tegra<chip>-mipi"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
  - clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: Must include the following entries:
    - mipi-cal
  - #nvidia,mipi-calibrate-cells: Should be 1. The cell is a bitmask of the pads
    that need to be calibrated for a given device.

  User nodes need to contain an nvidia,mipi-calibrate property that has a
  phandle to refer to the calibration controller node and a bitmask of the pads
  that need to be calibrated.
