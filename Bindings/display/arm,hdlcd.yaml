  This is a display controller found on several development platforms produced
  by ARM Ltd and in more modern of its' Fast Models. The HDLCD is an RGB
  streamer that reads the data from a framebuffer and sends it to a single
  digital encoder (DVI or HDMI).

  ARM HDLCD

  This is a display controller found on several development platforms produced
  by ARM Ltd and in more modern of its' Fast Models. The HDLCD is an RGB
  streamer that reads the data from a framebuffer and sends it to a single
  digital encoder (DVI or HDMI).

  Required properties:
    - compatible: "arm,hdlcd"
    - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
    - interrupts: One interrupt used by the display controller to notify the
      interrupt controller when any of the interrupt sources programmed in
      the interrupt mask register have activated.
    - clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each
      entry in 'clock-names'.
    - clock-names: A list of clock names. For HDLCD it should contain:
        - "pxlclk" for the clock feeding the output PLL of the controller.

  Required sub-nodes:
    - port: The HDLCD connection to an encoder chip. The connection is modeled
      using the OF graph bindings specified in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

  Optional properties:
    - memory-region: phandle to a node describing memory (see
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt) to be
      used for the framebuffer; if not present, the framebuffer may be located
      anywhere in memory.
