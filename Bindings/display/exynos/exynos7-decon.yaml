  Device-Tree bindings for Samsung Exynos7 SoC display controller (DECON)

  DECON (Display and Enhancement Controller) is the Display Controller for the
  Exynos7 series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
  buffer to an external LCD interface.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be "samsung,exynos7-decon";

  - reg: physical base address and length of the DECON registers set.

  - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle of the decon controller's
  		parent interrupt controller.

  - interrupts: should contain a list of all DECON IP block interrupts in the
  		 order: FIFO Level, VSYNC, LCD_SYSTEM. The interrupt specifier
  		 format depends on the interrupt controller used.

  - interrupt-names: should contain the interrupt names: "fifo", "vsync",
  	"lcd_sys", in the same order as they were listed in the interrupts
          property.

  - pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.

  - pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.

  - clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
           clock-names property.

  - clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
                 property. Must contain "pclk_decon0", "aclk_decon0",
  	       "decon0_eclk", "decon0_vclk".
  - i80-if-timings: timing configuration for lcd i80 interface support.

  Optional Properties:
  - power-domains: a phandle to DECON power domain node.
  - display-timings: timing settings for DECON, as described in document [1].
  		Can be used in case timings cannot be provided otherwise
  		or to override timings provided by the panel.
