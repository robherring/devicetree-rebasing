  Device-Tree bindings for Samsung Exynos SoC display controller (DECON)

  DECON (Display and Enhancement Controller) is the Display Controller for the
  Exynos series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
  buffer to an external LCD interface.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be one of:
  	"samsung,exynos5433-decon", "samsung,exynos5433-decon-tv";
  - reg: physical base address and length of the DECON registers set.
  - interrupt-names: should contain the interrupt names depending on mode of work:
  		video mode: "vsync",
  		command mode: "lcd_sys",
  		command mode with software trigger: "lcd_sys", "te".
  - interrupts or interrupts-extended: list of interrupt specifiers corresponding
  		to names privided in interrupt-names, as described in
  		interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
  - clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
  	  clock-names property.
  - clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
  	       property. Must contain "pclk", "aclk_decon", "aclk_smmu_decon0x",
  	       "aclk_xiu_decon0x", "pclk_smmu_decon0x", clk_decon_vclk",
  	       "sclk_decon_eclk"
  - ports: contains a port which is connected to mic node. address-cells and
  	 size-cells must 1 and 0, respectively.
  - port: contains an endpoint node which is connected to the endpoint in the mic
  	node. The reg value muset be 0.
