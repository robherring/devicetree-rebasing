  * Solomon SSD1307 Framebuffer Driver

  Required properties:
    - compatible: Should be "solomon,<chip>fb-<bus>". The only supported bus for
      now is i2c, and the supported chips are ssd1305, ssd1306, ssd1307 and
      ssd1309.
    - reg: Should contain address of the controller on the I2C bus. Most likely
           0x3c or 0x3d
    - pwm: Should contain the pwm to use according to the OF device tree PWM
           specification [0]. Only required for the ssd1307.
    - solomon,height: Height in pixel of the screen driven by the controller
    - solomon,width: Width in pixel of the screen driven by the controller
    - solomon,page-offset: Offset of pages (band of 8 pixels) that the screen is
      mapped to.

  Optional properties:
    - reset-gpios: The GPIO used to reset the OLED display, if available. See
                   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt for details.
    - vbat-supply: The supply for VBAT
    - solomon,segment-no-remap: Display needs normal (non-inverted) data column
                                to segment mapping
    - solomon,com-seq: Display uses sequential COM pin configuration
    - solomon,com-lrremap: Display uses left-right COM pin remap
    - solomon,com-invdir: Display uses inverted COM pin scan direction
    - solomon,com-offset: Number of the COM pin wired to the first display line
    - solomon,prechargep1: Length of deselect period (phase 1) in clock cycles.
    - solomon,prechargep2: Length of precharge period (phase 2) in clock cycles.
                           This needs to be the higher, the higher the capacitance
                           of the OLED's pixels is
