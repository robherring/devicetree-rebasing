  Mediatek HDMI Encoder
  =====================

  The Mediatek HDMI encoder can generate HDMI 1.4a or MHL 2.0 signals from
  its parallel input.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi".
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
  - clocks: device clocks
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: must contain "pixel", "pll", "bclk", and "spdif".
  - phys: phandle link to the HDMI PHY node.
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt for details.
  - phy-names: must contain "hdmi"
  - mediatek,syscon-hdmi: phandle link and register offset to the system
    configuration registers. For mt8173 this must be offset 0x900 into the
    MMSYS_CONFIG region: <&mmsys 0x900>.
  - ports: A node containing input and output port nodes with endpoint
    definitions as documented in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
  - port@0: The input port in the ports node should be connected to a DPI output
    port.
  - port@1: The output port in the ports node should be connected to the input
    port of a connector node that contains a ddc-i2c-bus property, or to the
    input port of an attached bridge chip, such as a SlimPort transmitter.

  HDMI CEC
  ========

  The HDMI CEC controller handles hotplug detection and CEC communication.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-cec"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
  - clocks: device clock

  HDMI DDC
  ========

  The HDMI DDC i2c controller is used to interface with the HDMI DDC pins.
  The Mediatek's I2C controller is used to interface with I2C devices.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi-ddc"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - clocks: device clock
  - clock-names: Should be "ddc-i2c".

  HDMI PHY
  ========

  The HDMI PHY serializes the HDMI encoder's three channel 10-bit parallel
  output and drives the HDMI pads.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-hdmi-phy"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the module's registers
  - clocks: PLL reference clock
  - clock-names: must contain "pll_ref"
  - clock-output-names: must be "hdmitx_dig_cts" on mt8173
  - #phy-cells: must be <0>
  - #clock-cells: must be <0>

  Optional properties:
  - mediatek,ibias: TX DRV bias current for <1.65Gbps, defaults to 0xa
  - mediatek,ibias_up: TX DRV bias current for >1.65Gbps, defaults to 0x1c
