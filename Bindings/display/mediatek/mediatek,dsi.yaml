  Mediatek DSI Device
  ===================

  The Mediatek DSI function block is a sink of the display subsystem and can
  drive up to 4-lane MIPI DSI output. Two DSIs can be synchronized for dual-
  channel output.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-dsi"
    the supported chips are mt2701 and mt8173.
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
  - clocks: device clocks
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: must contain "engine", "digital", and "hs"
  - phys: phandle link to the MIPI D-PHY controller.
  - phy-names: must contain "dphy"
  - port: Output port node with endpoint definitions as described in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. This port should be connected
    to the input port of an attached DSI panel or DSI-to-eDP encoder chip.

  MIPI TX Configuration Module
  ============================

  The MIPI TX configuration module controls the MIPI D-PHY.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-mipi-tx"
    the supported chips are mt2701 and mt8173.
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - clocks: PLL reference clock
  - clock-output-names: name of the output clock line to the DSI encoder
  - #clock-cells: must be <0>;
  - #phy-cells: must be <0>.
