  Mediatek DPI Device
  ===================

  The Mediatek DPI function block is a sink of the display subsystem and
  provides 8-bit RGB/YUV444 or 8/10/10-bit YUV422 pixel data on a parallel
  output bus.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-dpi"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
  - clocks: device clocks
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: must contain "pixel", "engine", and "pll"
  - port: Output port node with endpoint definitions as described in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. This port should be connected
    to the input port of an attached HDMI or LVDS encoder chip.
