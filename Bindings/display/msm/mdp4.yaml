  Qualcomm adreno/snapdragon MDP4 display controller

  Description:

  This is the bindings documentation for the MDP4 display controller found in
  SoCs like MSM8960, APQ8064 and MSM8660.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:
    * "qcom,mdp4" - mdp4
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
  - interrupts: The interrupt signal from the display controller.
  - clocks: device clocks
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: the following clocks are required.
    * "core_clk"
    * "iface_clk"
    * "bus_clk"
    * "lut_clk"
    * "hdmi_clk"
    * "tv_clk"
  - ports: contains the list of output ports from MDP. These connect to interfaces
    that are external to the MDP hardware, such as HDMI, DSI, EDP etc (LVDS is a
    special case since it is a part of the MDP block itself).

    Each output port contains an endpoint that describes how it is connected to an
    external interface. These are described by the standard properties documented
    here:
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

    The output port mappings are:
  	Port 0 -> LCDC/LVDS
  	Port 1 -> DSI1 Cmd/Video
  	Port 2 -> DSI2 Cmd/Video
  	Port 3 -> DTV

  Optional properties:
  - clock-names: the following clocks are optional:
    * "lut_clk"
