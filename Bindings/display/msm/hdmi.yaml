  - reg-names: "core_physical"
  - interrupts: The interrupt signal from the hdmi block.
  - power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
  - clocks: device clocks
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - core-vdda-supply: phandle to supply regulator
  - hdmi-mux-supply: phandle to mux regulator
  - phys: the phandle for the HDMI PHY device

  - qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-sel-gpios: hdmi mux select pin
  - qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-lpm-gpios: hdmi mux lpm pin
  - power-domains: reference to the power domain(s), if available.
  - pinctrl-names: the pin control state names; should contain "default"
  - pinctrl-0: the default pinctrl state (active)
  - pinctrl-1: the "sleep" pinctrl state

  HDMI PHY:
  Required properties:
  - compatible: Could be the following
    * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8660"
