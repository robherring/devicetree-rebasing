  Qualcomm adreno/snapdragon GPU

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "qcom,adreno-XYZ.W", "qcom,adreno"
      for example: "qcom,adreno-306.0", "qcom,adreno"
    Note that you need to list the less specific "qcom,adreno" (since this
    is what the device is matched on), in addition to the more specific
    with the chip-id.
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
  - interrupts: The interrupt signal from the gpu.
  - clocks: device clocks
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: the following clocks are required:
    * "core"
    * "iface"
    * "mem_iface"

...
