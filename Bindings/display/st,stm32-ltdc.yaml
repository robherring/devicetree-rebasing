  * STMicroelectronics STM32 lcd-tft display controller

  - ltdc: lcd-tft display controller host
    Required properties:
    - compatible: "st,stm32-ltdc"
    - reg: Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory mapped region.
    - clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each
      entry in 'clock-names'.
    - clock-names: A list of clock names. For ltdc it should contain:
        - "lcd" for the clock feeding the output pixel clock & IP clock.
    - resets: reset to be used by the device (defined by use of RCC macro).
    Required nodes:
    - Video port for DPI RGB output: ltdc has one video port with up to 2
      endpoints:
        - for external dpi rgb panel or bridge, using gpios.
        - for internal dpi input of the MIPI DSI host controller.
        Note: These 2 endpoints cannot be activated simultaneously.

  * STMicroelectronics STM32 DSI controller specific extensions to Synopsys
    DesignWare MIPI DSI host controller

  The STMicroelectronics STM32 DSI controller uses the Synopsys DesignWare MIPI
  DSI host controller. For all mandatory properties & nodes, please refer
  to the related documentation in [5].

  Mandatory properties specific to STM32 DSI:
  - #address-cells: Should be <1>.
  - #size-cells: Should be <0>.
  - compatible: "st,stm32-dsi".
  - clock-names:
    - phy pll reference clock string name, must be "ref".
  - resets: see [5].
  - reset-names: see [5].

  Mandatory nodes specific to STM32 DSI:
  - ports: A node containing DSI input & output port nodes with endpoint
    definitions as documented in [3] & [4].
    - port@0: DSI input port node, connected to the ltdc rgb output port.
    - port@1: DSI output port node, connected to a panel or a bridge input port.
  - panel or bridge node: A node containing the panel or bridge description as
    documented in [6].
    - port: panel or bridge port node, connected to the DSI output port (port@1).
