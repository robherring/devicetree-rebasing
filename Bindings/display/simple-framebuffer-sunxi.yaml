title: Sunxi specific Simple Framebuffer bindings

maintainers:

description: |+
  This binding documents sunxi specific extensions to the simple-framebuffer
  bindings. The sunxi simplefb u-boot code relies on the devicetree containing
  pre-populated simplefb nodes.

  These extensions are intended so that u-boot can select the right node based
  on which pipeline is being used. As such they are solely intended for
  firmware / bootloader use, and the OS should ignore them.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "allwinner,simple-framebuffer"
  - allwinner,pipeline, one of:
    "de_be0-lcd0"
    "de_be1-lcd1"
