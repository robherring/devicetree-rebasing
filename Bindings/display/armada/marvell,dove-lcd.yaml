  Device Tree bindings for Armada DRM CRTC driver

  Required properties:
   - compatible: value should be "marvell,dove-lcd".
   - reg: base address and size of the LCD controller
   - interrupts: single interrupt number for the LCD controller
   - port: video output port with endpoints, as described by graph.txt

  Optional properties:

   - clocks: as described by clock-bindings.txt
   - clock-names: as described by clock-bindings.txt
  	"axiclk" - axi bus clock for pixel clock
  	"plldivider" - pll divider clock for pixel clock
  	"ext_ref_clk0" - external clock 0 for pixel clock
  	"ext_ref_clk1" - external clock 1 for pixel clock

  Note: all clocks are optional but at least one must be specified.
  Further clocks may be added in the future according to requirements of
  different SoCs.
