  Rockchip RK3288 LVDS interface
  ================================

  Required properties:
  - compatible: matching the soc type, one of
  	- "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length
  	of memory mapped region.
  - clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
  	clock-names property.
  - clock-names: must contain "pclk_lvds"

  - avdd1v0-supply: regulator phandle for 1.0V analog power
  - avdd1v8-supply: regulator phandle for 1.8V analog power
  - avdd3v3-supply: regulator phandle for 3.3V analog power

  - rockchip,grf: phandle to the general register files syscon
  - rockchip,output: "rgb", "lvds" or "duallvds", This describes the output interface

  Optional properties:
  - pinctrl-names: must contain a "lcdc" entry.
  - pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.

  Required nodes:

  The lvds has two video ports as described by
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt
  Their connections are modeled using the OF graph bindings specified in
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

  - video port 0 for the VOP input, the remote endpoint maybe vopb or vopl
  - video port 1 for either a panel or subsequent encoder

  the lvds panel described by
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/simple-panel.txt

  Panel required properties:
  - ports for remote LVDS output

  Panel optional properties:
  - data-mapping: should be "vesa-24","jeida-24" or "jeida-18".
  This describes decribed by:
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/panel-lvds.txt
