  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/bridge/dw_hdmi.txt with the
  following device-specific properties.


  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following:
  		"rockchip,rk3288-dw-hdmi"
  		"rockchip,rk3399-dw-hdmi"
  - reg: See dw_hdmi.txt.
  - reg-io-width: See dw_hdmi.txt. Shall be 4.
  - interrupts: HDMI interrupt number
