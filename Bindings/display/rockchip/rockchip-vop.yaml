  VOP (Visual Output Processor) is the Display Controller for the Rockchip
  series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
  buffer to an external LCD interface.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be one of the following
  		"rockchip,rk3036-vop";
  		"rockchip,rk3126-vop";
  		"rockchip,rk3288-vop";
  		"rockchip,rk3368-vop";
  		"rockchip,rk3366-vop";
  		"rockchip,rk3399-vop-big";
  		"rockchip,rk3399-vop-lit";
  		"rockchip,rk3228-vop";
  		"rockchip,rk3328-vop";

  - interrupts: should contain a list of all VOP IP block interrupts in the
  		 order: VSYNC, LCD_SYSTEM. The interrupt specifier
  		 format depends on the interrupt controller used.

  - clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
  		clock-names property.

  - clock-names: Must contain
  		aclk_vop: for ddr buffer transfer.
  		hclk_vop: for ahb bus to R/W the phy regs.
  		dclk_vop: pixel clock.

  - resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names: Must include the following entries:
    - axi
    - ahb
    - dclk

  - iommus: required a iommu node

  - port: A port node with endpoint definitions as defined in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
