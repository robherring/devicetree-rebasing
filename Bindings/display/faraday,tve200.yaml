  * Faraday TV Encoder TVE200

  Required properties:

  - compatible: must be one of:
  	"faraday,tve200"
  	"cortina,gemini-tvc", "faraday,tve200"

  - reg: base address and size of the control registers block

  - interrupts: contains an interrupt specifier for the interrupt
  	line from the TVE200

  - clock-names: should contain "PCLK" for the clock line clocking the
  	silicon and "TVE" for the 27MHz clock to the video driver

  - clocks: contains phandle and clock specifier pairs for the entries
  	in the clock-names property. See
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  Optional properties:

  - resets: contains the reset line phandle for the block

  Required sub-nodes:

  - port: describes LCD panel signals, following the common binding
  	for video transmitter interfaces; see
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt
  	This port should have the properties:
  	reg = <0>;
  	It should have one endpoint connected to a remote endpoint where
  	the display is connected.
