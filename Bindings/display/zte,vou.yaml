title: ZTE VOU Display Controller

maintainers:
  - Shawn Guo <shawn.guo@linaro.org>
description: |+
  This is a display controller found on ZTE ZX296718 SoC.  It includes multiple
  Graphic Layer (GL) and Video Layer (VL), two Mixers/Channels, and a few blocks
  handling scaling, color space conversion etc.  VOU also integrates the support
  for typical output devices, like HDMI, TV Encoder, VGA, and RGB LCD.

  * Master VOU node

  It must be the parent node of all the sub-device nodes.

  ZTE VOU Display Controller

  This is a display controller found on ZTE ZX296718 SoC.  It includes multiple
  Graphic Layer (GL) and Video Layer (VL), two Mixers/Channels, and a few blocks
  handling scaling, color space conversion etc.  VOU also integrates the support
  for typical output devices, like HDMI, TV Encoder, VGA, and RGB LCD.

  * Master VOU node

  It must be the parent node of all the sub-device nodes.

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "zte,zx296718-vou"
   - #address-cells: should be <1>
   - #size-cells: should be <1>
   - ranges: list of address translations between VOU and sub-devices

  * VOU DPC device

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "zte,zx296718-dpc"
   - reg: Physical base address and length of DPC register regions, one for each
     entry in 'reg-names'
   - reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  	"osd"
  	"timing_ctrl"
  	"dtrc"
  	"vou_ctrl"
  	"otfppu"
   - interrupts: VOU DPC interrupt number to CPU
   - clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
     in 'clock-names'
   - clock-names: A list of clock names.  The following clocks are required:
  	"aclk"
  	"ppu_wclk"
  	"main_wclk"
  	"aux_wclk"

  * HDMI output device

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "zte,zx296718-hdmi"
   - reg: Physical base address and length of the HDMI device IO region
   - interrupts : HDMI interrupt number to CPU
   - clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
     in 'clock-names'
   - clock-names: A list of clock names.  The following clocks are required:
  	"osc_cec"
  	"osc_clk"
  	"xclk"

  * TV Encoder output device

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "zte,zx296718-tvenc"
   - reg: Physical base address and length of the TVENC device IO region
   - zte,tvenc-power-control: the phandle to SYSCTRL block followed by two
     integer cells.  The first cell is the offset of SYSCTRL register used
     to control TV Encoder DAC power, and the second cell is the bit mask.

  * VGA output device

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "zte,zx296718-vga"
   - reg: Physical base address and length of the VGA device IO region
   - interrupts : VGA interrupt number to CPU
   - clocks: Phandle with clock-specifier pointing to VGA I2C clock.
   - clock-names: Must be "i2c_wclk".
   - zte,vga-power-control: the phandle to SYSCTRL block followed by two
     integer cells.  The first cell is the offset of SYSCTRL register used
     to control VGA DAC power, and the second cell is the bit mask.
