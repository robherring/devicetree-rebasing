  This is a display controller found on several development boards produced
  by Synopsys. The ARC PGU is an RGB streamer that reads the data from a
  framebuffer and sends it to a single digital encoder (usually HDMI).

  ARC PGU

  This is a display controller found on several development boards produced
  by Synopsys. The ARC PGU is an RGB streamer that reads the data from a
  framebuffer and sends it to a single digital encoder (usually HDMI).

  Required properties:
    - compatible: "snps,arcpgu"
    - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
    - clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each
      entry in 'clock-names'.
    - clock-names: A list of clock names. For ARC PGU it should contain:
        - "pxlclk" for the clock feeding the output PLL of the controller.

  Required sub-nodes:
    - port: The PGU connection to an encoder chip.
