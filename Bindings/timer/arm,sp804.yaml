  ARM sp804 Dual Timers
  ---------------------------------------

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "arm,sp804" & "arm,primecell"
  - interrupts: Should contain the list of Dual Timer interrupts. This is the
  	interrupt for timer 1 and timer 2. In the case of a single entry, it is
  	the combined interrupt or if "arm,sp804-has-irq" is present that
  	specifies which timer interrupt is connected.
  - reg: Should contain location and length for dual timer register.
  - clocks: clocks driving the dual timer hardware. This list should be 1 or 3
  	clocks.	With 3 clocks, the order is timer0 clock, timer1 clock,
  	apb_pclk. A single clock can also be specified if the same clock is
  	used for all clock inputs.

  Optional properties:
  - arm,sp804-has-irq = <#>: In the case of only 1 timer irq line connected, this
  	specifies if the irq connection is for timer 1 or timer 2. A value of 1
  	or 2 should be used.
