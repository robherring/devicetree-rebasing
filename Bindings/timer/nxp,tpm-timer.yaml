title: NXP Low Power Timer/Pulse Width Modulation Module (TPM)

maintainers:

description: |+
  The Timer/PWM Module (TPM) supports input capture, output compare,
  and the generation of PWM signals to control electric motor and power
  management applications. The counter, compare and capture registers
  are clocked by an asynchronous clock that can remain enabled in low
  power modes. TPM can support global counter bus where one TPM drives
  the counter bus for the others, provided bit width is the same.

  NXP Low Power Timer/Pulse Width Modulation Module (TPM)

  The Timer/PWM Module (TPM) supports input capture, output compare,
  and the generation of PWM signals to control electric motor and power

  are clocked by an asynchronous clock that can remain enabled in low
  power modes. TPM can support global counter bus where one TPM drives

  Required properties:

  - compatible :	should be "fsl,imx7ulp-tpm"
  - reg :		Specifies base physical address and size of the register sets
  		for the clock event device and clock source device.
  - interrupts :	Should be the clock event device interrupt.
  - clocks :	The clocks provided by the SoC to drive the timer, must contain
  		an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names : Must include the following entries: "igp" and "per".
