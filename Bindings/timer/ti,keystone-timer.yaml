description: |+
  This document provides bindings for the 64-bit timer in the KeyStone
  architecture devices. The timer can be configured as a general-purpose 64-bit
  timer, dual general-purpose 32-bit timers. When configured as dual 32-bit
  timers, each half can operate in conjunction (chain mode) or independently
  (unchained mode) of each other.

  It is global timer is a free running up-counter and can generate interrupt
  when the counter reaches preset counter values.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "ti,keystone-timer".
  - reg : specifies base physical address and count of the registers.
  - interrupts : interrupt generated by the timer.
  - clocks : the clock feeding the timer clock.
