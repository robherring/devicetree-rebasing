  The OSTM is a multi-channel 32-bit timer/counter with fixed clock
  source that can operate in either interval count down timer or free-running
  compare match mode.

  Channels are independent from each other.

  * Renesas OS Timer (OSTM)

  The OSTM is a multi-channel 32-bit timer/counter with fixed clock
  source that can operate in either interval count down timer or free-running
  compare match mode.

  Channels are independent from each other.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: must be one or more of the following:
      - "renesas,r7s72100-ostm" for the r7s72100 OSTM
      - "renesas,ostm" for any OSTM
  		This is a fallback for the above renesas,*-ostm entries

    - reg: base address and length of the register block for a timer channel.

    - interrupts: interrupt specifier for the timer channel.

    - clocks: clock specifier for the timer channel.
