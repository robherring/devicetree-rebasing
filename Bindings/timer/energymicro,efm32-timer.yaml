description: |+
  The efm32 Giant Gecko SoCs come with four 16 bit timers. Two counters can be
  connected to form a 32 bit counter. Each timer has three Compare/Capture
  channels and can be used as PWM or Quadrature Decoder. Available clock sources
  are the cpu's HFPERCLK (with a 10-bit prescaler) or an external pin.

  * EFM32 timer hardware

  The efm32 Giant Gecko SoCs come with four 16 bit timers. Two counters can be
  connected to form a 32 bit counter. Each timer has three Compare/Capture
  channels and can be used as PWM or Quadrature Decoder. Available clock sources
  are the cpu's HFPERCLK (with a 10-bit prescaler) or an external pin.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "energymicro,efm32-timer"
  - reg : Address and length of the register set
  - clocks : Should contain a reference to the HFPERCLK

  Optional properties:
  - interrupts : Reference to the timer interrupt
