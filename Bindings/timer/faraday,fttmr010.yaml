  Faraday Technology timer

  This timer is a generic IP block from Faraday Technology, embedded in the
  Cortina Systems Gemini SoCs and other designs.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : Must be one of
    "faraday,fttmr010"
    "cortina,gemini-timer", "faraday,fttmr010"
    "moxa,moxart-timer", "faraday,fttmr010"
    "aspeed,ast2400-timer"
    "aspeed,ast2500-timer"

  - reg : Should contain registers location and length
  - interrupts : Should contain the three timer interrupts usually with
    flags for falling edge

  Optionally required properties:

  - clocks : a clock to provide the tick rate for "faraday,fttmr010"
  - clock-names : should be "EXTCLK" and "PCLK" for the external tick timer
    and peripheral clock respectively, for "faraday,fttmr010"
  - syscon : a phandle to the global Gemini system controller if the compatible
    type is "cortina,gemini-timer"
