  Freescale FlexTimer Module (FTM) Timer

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "fsl,ftm-timer"
  - reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the register sets for the
    clock event device and clock source device.
  - interrupts : Should be the clock event device interrupt.
  - clocks : The clocks provided by the SoC to drive the timer, must contain an
    entry for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names : Must include the following entries:
    o "ftm-evt"
    o "ftm-src"
    o "ftm-evt-counter-en"
    o "ftm-src-counter-en"
  - big-endian: One boolean property, the big endian mode will be in use if it is
    present, or the little endian mode will be in use for all the device registers.
