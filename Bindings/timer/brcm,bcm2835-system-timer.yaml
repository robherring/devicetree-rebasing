description: |+
  The System Timer peripheral provides four 32-bit timer channels and a
  single 64-bit free running counter. Each channel has an output compare
  register, which is compared against the 32 least significant bits of the
  free running counter values, and generates an interrupt.

  BCM2835 System Timer

  The System Timer peripheral provides four 32-bit timer channels and a
  single 64-bit free running counter. Each channel has an output compare
  register, which is compared against the 32 least significant bits of the
  free running counter values, and generates an interrupt.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "brcm,bcm2835-system-timer"
  - reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
  - interrupts : A list of 4 interrupt sinks; one per timer channel.
  - clock-frequency : The frequency of the clock that drives the counter, in Hz.
