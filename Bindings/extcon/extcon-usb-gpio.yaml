  USB GPIO Extcon device

  This is a virtual device used to generate USB cable states from the USB ID pin
  connected to a GPIO pin.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "linux,extcon-usb-gpio"

  Either one of id-gpio or vbus-gpio must be present. Both can be present as well.
  - id-gpio: gpio for USB ID pin. See gpio binding.
  - vbus-gpio: gpio for USB VBUS pin.
