  * AHCI SATA Controller

  SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
  Each SATA controller should have its own node.

  It is possible, but not required, to represent each port as a sub-node.
  It allows to enable each port independently when dealing with multiple
  PHYs.

  Required properties:
  - compatible        : compatible string, one of:
    - "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ahci"
    - "brcm,iproc-ahci"
    - "hisilicon,hisi-ahci"
    - "cavium,octeon-7130-ahci"
    - "ibm,476gtr-ahci"
    - "marvell,armada-380-ahci"
    - "marvell,armada-3700-ahci"
    - "snps,dwc-ahci"
    - "snps,exynos5440-ahci"
    - "snps,spear-ahci"
    - "generic-ahci"
  - interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
  - reg               : <registers mapping>

  Please note that when using "generic-ahci" you must also specify a SoC specific
  compatible:
  	compatible = "manufacturer,soc-model-ahci", "generic-ahci";

  Optional properties:
  - dma-coherent      : Present if dma operations are coherent
  - clocks            : a list of phandle + clock specifier pairs
  - target-supply     : regulator for SATA target power
  - phys              : reference to the SATA PHY node
  - phy-names         : must be "sata-phy"
  - ports-implemented : Mask that indicates which ports that the HBA supports
  		      are available for software to use. Useful if PORTS_IMPL
  		      is not programmed by the BIOS, which is true with
  		      some embedded SOC's.

  Required properties when using sub-nodes:
  - #address-cells    : number of cells to encode an address
  - #size-cells       : number of cells representing the size of an address


  Sub-nodes required properties:
  - reg		    : the port number
  And at least one of the following properties:
  - phys		    : reference to the SATA PHY node
  - target-supply    : regulator for SATA target power
