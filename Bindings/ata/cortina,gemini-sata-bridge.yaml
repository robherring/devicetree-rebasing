  * Cortina Systems Gemini SATA Bridge

  The Gemini SATA bridge in a SoC-internal PATA to SATA bridge that
  takes two Faraday Technology FTIDE010 PATA controllers and bridges
  them in different configurations to two SATA ports.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be
    "cortina,gemini-sata-bridge"
  - reg: registers and size for the block
  - resets: phandles to the reset lines for both SATA bridges
  - reset-names: must be "sata0", "sata1"
  - clocks: phandles to the compulsory peripheral clocks
  - clock-names: must be "SATA0_PCLK", "SATA1_PCLK"
  - syscon: a phandle to the global Gemini system controller
  - cortina,gemini-ata-muxmode: tell the desired multiplexing mode for
    the ATA controller and SATA bridges. Values 0..3:
    Mode 0: ata0 master <-> sata0
            ata1 master <-> sata1
            ata0 slave interface brought out on IDE pads
    Mode 1: ata0 master <-> sata0
            ata1 master <-> sata1
            ata1 slave interface brought out on IDE pads
    Mode 2: ata1 master <-> sata1
            ata1 slave  <-> sata0
            ata0 master and slave interfaces brought out
                 on IDE pads
    Mode 3: ata0 master <-> sata0
            ata0 slave  <-> sata1
            ata1 master and slave interfaces brought out
                 on IDE pads

  Optional boolean properties:
  - cortina,gemini-enable-ide-pins: enables the PATA to IDE connection.
    The muxmode setting decides whether ATA0 or ATA1 is brought out,
    and whether master, slave or both interfaces get brought out.
  - cortina,gemini-enable-sata-bridge: enables the PATA to SATA bridge
    inside the Gemnini SoC. The Muxmode decides what PATA blocks will
    be muxed out and how.
