  * Broadcom SATA3 AHCI Controller

  SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
  Each SATA controller should have its own node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible         : should be one or more of
  			"brcm,bcm7425-ahci"
  			"brcm,bcm7445-ahci"
  			"brcm,bcm-nsp-ahci"
  			"brcm,sata3-ahci"
  - reg                : register mappings for AHCI and SATA_TOP_CTRL
  - reg-names          : "ahci" and "top-ctrl"
  - interrupts         : interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ
