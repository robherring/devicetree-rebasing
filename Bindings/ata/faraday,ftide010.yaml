title: Faraday Technology FTIDE010 PATA controller

maintainers:
  - Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>
description: |+
  This controller is the first Faraday IDE interface block, used in the
  StorLink SL2312 and SL3516, later known as the Cortina Systems Gemini
  platform. The controller can do PIO modes 0 through 4, Multi-word DMA
  (MWDM)modes 0 through 2 and Ultra DMA modes 0 through 6.

  On the Gemini platform, this PATA block is accompanied by a PATA to
  SATA bridge in order to support SATA. This is why a phandle to that
  controller is compulsory on that platform.

  The timing properties are unique per-SoC, not per-board.

  * Faraday Technology FTIDE010 PATA controller

  This controller is the first Faraday IDE interface block, used in the
  StorLink SL2312 and SL3516, later known as the Cortina Systems Gemini
  platform. The controller can do PIO modes 0 through 4, Multi-word DMA
  (MWDM)modes 0 through 2 and Ultra DMA modes 0 through 6.

  On the Gemini platform, this PATA block is accompanied by a PATA to
  SATA bridge in order to support SATA. This is why a phandle to that
  controller is compulsory on that platform.

  The timing properties are unique per-SoC, not per-board.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be one of
    "cortina,gemini-pata", "faraday,ftide010"
    "faraday,ftide010"
  - interrupts: interrupt for the block
  - reg: registers and size for the block

  Optional properties:
  - clocks: a SoC clock running the peripheral.
  - clock-names: should be set to "PCLK" for the peripheral clock.

  Required properties for "cortina,gemini-pata" compatible:
  - sata: a phande to the Gemini PATA to SATA bridge, see
    cortina,gemini-sata-bridge.txt for details.
