  * Calxeda AHCI SATA Controller

  SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
  The Calxeda SATA controller mostly conforms to the AHCI interface
  with some special extensions to add functionality.
  Each SATA controller should have its own node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible        : compatible list, contains "calxeda,hb-ahci"
  - interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
  - reg               : <registers mapping>

  Optional properties:
  - dma-coherent      : Present if dma operations are coherent
  - calxeda,port-phys : phandle-combophy and lane assignment, which maps each
  			SATA port to a combophy and a lane within that
  			combophy
  - calxeda,sgpio-gpio: phandle-gpio bank, bit offset, and default on or off,
  			which indicates that the driver supports SGPIO
  			indicator lights using the indicated GPIOs
  - calxeda,led-order : a u32 array that map port numbers to offsets within the
  			SGPIO bitstream.
  - calxeda,tx-atten  : a u32 array that contains TX attenuation override
  			codes, one per port. The upper 3 bytes are always
  			0 and thus ignored.
  - calxeda,pre-clocks : a u32 that indicates the number of additional clock
  			cycles to transmit before sending an SGPIO pattern
  - calxeda,post-clocks: a u32 that indicates the number of additional clock
  			cycles to transmit after sending an SGPIO pattern
