  This is DT specific glue layer for generic cpufreq driver for big LITTLE
  systems.

  Both required and optional properties listed below must be defined
  under node /cpus/cpu@x. Where x is the first cpu inside a cluster.

  FIXME: Cpus should boot in the order specified in DT and all cpus for a cluster
  must be present contiguously. Generic DT driver will check only node 'x' for
  cpu:x.

  Generic ARM big LITTLE cpufreq driver's DT glue
  -----------------------------------------------

  This is DT specific glue layer for generic cpufreq driver for big LITTLE
  systems.

  Both required and optional properties listed below must be defined
  under node /cpus/cpu@x. Where x is the first cpu inside a cluster.

  FIXME: Cpus should boot in the order specified in DT and all cpus for a cluster
  must be present contiguously. Generic DT driver will check only node 'x' for
  cpu:x.

  Required properties:
  - operating-points: Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt
    for details

  Optional properties:
  - clock-latency: Specify the possible maximum transition latency for clock,
    in unit of nanoseconds.
