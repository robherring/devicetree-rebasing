  SPEAr cpufreq driver
  -------------------

  SPEAr SoC cpufreq driver for CPU frequency scaling.
  It supports both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems
  which share clock across all CPUs.

  Required properties:
  - cpufreq_tbl: Table of frequencies CPU could be transitioned into, in the
    increasing order.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-latency: Specify the possible maximum transition latency for clock, in
    unit of nanoseconds.

  Both required and optional properties listed above must be defined under node
  /cpus/cpu@0.
