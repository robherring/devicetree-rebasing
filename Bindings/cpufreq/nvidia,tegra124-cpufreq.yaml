  Tegra124 CPU frequency scaling driver bindings
  ----------------------------------------------

  Both required and optional properties listed below must be defined
  under node /cpus/cpu@0.

  Required properties:
  - clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: Must include the following entries:
    - cpu_g: Clock mux for the fast CPU cluster.
    - cpu_lp: Clock mux for the low-power CPU cluster.
    - pll_x: Fast PLL clocksource.
    - pll_p: Auxiliary PLL used during fast PLL rate changes.
    - dfll: Fast DFLL clocksource that also automatically scales CPU voltage.
  - vdd-cpu-supply: Regulator for CPU voltage

  Optional properties:
  - clock-latency: Specify the possible maximum transition latency for clock,
    in unit of nanoseconds.
