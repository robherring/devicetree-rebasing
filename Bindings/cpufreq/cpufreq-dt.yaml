description: |+
  It is a generic DT based cpufreq driver for frequency management.  It supports
  both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems which share
  clock and voltage across all CPUs.

  Both required and optional properties listed below must be defined
  under node /cpus/cpu@0.

  Generic cpufreq driver

  It is a generic DT based cpufreq driver for frequency management.  It supports
  both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems which share
  clock and voltage across all CPUs.

  Both required and optional properties listed below must be defined
  under node /cpus/cpu@0.

  Required properties:
  - None

  Optional properties:
  - operating-points: Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt for
    details. OPPs *must* be supplied either via DT, i.e. this property, or
    populated at runtime.
  - clock-latency: Specify the possible maximum transition latency for clock,
    in unit of nanoseconds.
  - voltage-tolerance: Specify the CPU voltage tolerance in percentage.
  - #cooling-cells:
  - cooling-min-level:
  - cooling-max-level:
       Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt.
