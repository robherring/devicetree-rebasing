  The ti-cpufreq driver can use revision and an efuse value from the SoC to

  TI CPUFreq and OPP bindings
  ================================

  Certain TI SoCs, like those in the am335x, am437x, am57xx, and dra7xx
  families support different OPPs depending on the silicon variant in use.
  The ti-cpufreq driver can use revision and an efuse value from the SoC to
  provide the OPP framework with supported hardware information. This is
  used to determine which OPPs from the operating-points-v2 table get enabled
  when it is parsed by the OPP framework.

  Required properties:
  --------------------
  In 'cpus' nodes:
  - operating-points-v2: Phandle to the operating-points-v2 table to use.

  In 'operating-points-v2' table:
  - compatible: Should be
  	- 'operating-points-v2-ti-cpu' for am335x, am43xx, and dra7xx/am57xx SoCs
  - syscon: A phandle pointing to a syscon node representing the control module
  	  register space of the SoC.

  Optional properties:
  --------------------
  For each opp entry in 'operating-points-v2' table:
  - opp-supported-hw: Two bitfields indicating:
  	1. Which revision of the SoC the OPP is supported by
  	2. Which eFuse bits indicate this OPP is available

  	A bitwise AND is performed against these values and if any bit
  	matches, the OPP gets enabled.
