  Exynos5440 cpufreq driver
  -------------------

  Exynos5440 SoC cpufreq driver for CPU frequency scaling.

  Required properties:
  - interrupts: Interrupt to know the completion of cpu frequency change.
  - operating-points: Table of frequencies and voltage CPU could be transitioned into,
  	in the decreasing order. Frequency should be in KHz units and voltage
  	should be in microvolts.

  Optional properties:
  - clock-latency: Clock monitor latency in microsecond.

  All the required listed above must be defined under node cpufreq.
