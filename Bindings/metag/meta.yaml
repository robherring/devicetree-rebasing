  * Meta Processor Binding

  This binding specifies what properties must be available in the device tree
  representation of a Meta Processor Core, which is the root node in the tree.

  Required properties:

      - compatible: Specifies the compatibility list for the Meta processor.
        The type shall be <string> and the value shall include "img,meta".

  Optional properties:

      - clocks: Clock consumer specifiers as described in
        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

      - clock-names: Clock consumer names as described in
        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt.

  Clocks are identified by name. Valid clocks are:

      - "core": The Meta core clock from which the Meta timers are derived.

  * Examples

  / {
  	compatible = "toumaz,tz1090", "img,meta";

  	clocks = <&meta_core_clk>;
  	clock-names = "core";
  };
