  Device tree bindings for Atmel capacitive touch device, typically
  an Atmel touch sensor connected to AtmegaXX MCU running firmware
  based on Qtouch library.

  The node for this device must be a child of a I2C controller node, as the
  device communicates via I2C.

  Required properties:

  	compatible:	Must be "atmel,captouch".
  	reg:		The I2C slave address of the device.
  	interrupts:	Property describing the interrupt line the device
  			is connected to. The device only has one interrupt
  			source.
  	linux,keycodes:	Specifies an array of numeric keycode values to
  			be used for reporting button presses. The array can
  			contain up to 8 entries.

  Optional properties:

  	autorepeat:	Enables the Linux input system's autorepeat
  			feature on the input device.
