  * Tegra keyboard controller
  The key controller has maximum 24 pins to make matrix keypad. Any pin
  can be configured as row or column. The maximum column pin can be 8
  and maximum row pins can be 16 for Tegra20/Tegra30.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "nvidia,tegra20-kbc"
  - reg: Register base address of KBC.
  - interrupts: Interrupt number for the KBC.
  - nvidia,kbc-row-pins: The KBC pins which are configured as row. This is an
    array of pin numbers which is used as rows.
  - nvidia,kbc-col-pins: The KBC pins which are configured as column. This is an
    array of pin numbers which is used as column.
  - linux,keymap: The keymap for keys as described in the binding document
    devicetree/bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt.
  - clocks: Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names: Must include the following entries:
    - kbc

  Optional properties, in addition to those specified by the shared
  matrix-keyboard bindings:

  - linux,fn-keymap: a second keymap, same specification as the
    matrix-keyboard-controller spec but to be used when the KEY_FN modifier
    key is pressed.
  - nvidia,debounce-delay-ms: delay in milliseconds per row scan for debouncing
  - nvidia,repeat-delay-ms: delay in milliseconds before repeat starts
  - nvidia,ghost-filter: enable ghost filtering for this device
  - wakeup-source: configure keyboard as a wakeup source for suspend/resume
  		 (Legacy property supported: "nvidia,wakeup-source")
