  GPIO driven matrix keypad is used to interface a SoC with a matrix keypad.
  The matrix keypad supports multiple row and column lines, a key can be
  placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column. The matrix
  keypad can sense a key-press and key-release by means of GPIO lines and
  report the event using GPIO interrupts to the cpu.

  * GPIO driven matrix keypad device tree bindings

  GPIO driven matrix keypad is used to interface a SoC with a matrix keypad.
  The matrix keypad supports multiple row and column lines, a key can be
  placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column. The matrix
  keypad can sense a key-press and key-release by means of GPIO lines and
  report the event using GPIO interrupts to the cpu.

  Required Properties:
  - compatible:		Should be "gpio-matrix-keypad"
  - row-gpios:		List of gpios used as row lines. The gpio specifier
  			for this property depends on the gpio controller to
  			which these row lines are connected.
  - col-gpios:		List of gpios used as column lines. The gpio specifier
  			for this property depends on the gpio controller to
  			which these column lines are connected.
  - linux,keymap:		The definition can be found at
  			bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt

  Optional Properties:
  - linux,no-autorepeat:	do no enable autorepeat feature.
  - wakeup-source:	use any event on keypad as wakeup event.
  			(Legacy property supported: "linux,wakeup")
  - debounce-delay-ms:	debounce interval in milliseconds
  - col-scan-delay-us:	delay, measured in microseconds, that is needed
  			before we can scan keypad after activating column gpio
  - drive-inactive-cols:	drive inactive columns during scan,
  			default is to turn inactive columns into inputs.
