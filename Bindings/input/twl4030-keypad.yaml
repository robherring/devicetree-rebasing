title: TWL4030's Keypad Controller device tree bindings

maintainers:
  - Sebastian Reichel <sre@debian.org>
description: |+
  TWL4030's Keypad controller is used to interface a SoC with a matrix-type
  keypad device. The keypad controller supports multiple row and column lines.
  A key can be placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column.
  The keypad controller can sense a key-press and key-release and report the
  event using a interrupt to the cpu.

  This binding is based on the matrix-keymap binding with the following
  changes:

   * keypad,num-rows and keypad,num-columns are required.

             

properties:
  compatible: {}
examples:
  - |
    twl_keypad: keypad {
      compatible = "ti,twl4030-keypad";
      interrupts = <1>;
      keypad,num-rows = <8>;
      keypad,num-columns = <8>;

  Required SoC Specific Properties:
  - compatible: should be one of the following
     - "ti,twl4030-keypad": For controllers compatible with twl4030 keypad
        controller.
  - interrupt: should be one of the following
     - <1>: For controllers compatible with twl4030 keypad controller.
