  The KPP is designed to interface with a keypad matrix with 2-point contact
  or 3-point contact keys. The KPP is designed to simplify the software task
  of scanning a keypad matrix. The KPP is capable of detecting, debouncing,
  and decoding one or multiple keys pressed simultaneously on a keypad.

  * Freescale i.MX Keypad Port(KPP) device tree bindings

  The KPP is designed to interface with a keypad matrix with 2-point contact
  or 3-point contact keys. The KPP is designed to simplify the software task
  of scanning a keypad matrix. The KPP is capable of detecting, debouncing,
  and decoding one or multiple keys pressed simultaneously on a keypad.

  Required SoC Specific Properties:
  - compatible: Should be "fsl,<soc>-kpp".

  - reg: Physical base address of the KPP and length of memory mapped
    region.

  - interrupts: The KPP interrupt number to the CPU(s).

  - clocks: The clock provided by the SoC to the KPP. Some SoCs use dummy
  clock(The clock for the KPP is provided by the SoCs automatically).

  Required Board Specific Properties:
  - pinctrl-names: The definition can be found at
  pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.

  - pinctrl-0: The definition can be found at
  pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.

  - linux,keymap: The definition can be found at
  bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt.
