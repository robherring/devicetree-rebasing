description: |+
  Broadcom Keypad controller is used to interface a SoC with a matrix-type
  keypad device. The keypad controller supports multiple row and column lines.
  A key can be placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column.
  The keypad controller can sense a key-press and key-release and report the
  event using a interrupt to the cpu.

  This binding is based on the matrix-keymap binding with the following
  changes:

  keypad,num-rows and keypad,num-columns are required.

  * Broadcom Keypad Controller device tree bindings

  Broadcom Keypad controller is used to interface a SoC with a matrix-type
  keypad device. The keypad controller supports multiple row and column lines.
  A key can be placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column.
  The keypad controller can sense a key-press and key-release and report the
  event using a interrupt to the cpu.

  This binding is based on the matrix-keymap binding with the following
  changes:

  keypad,num-rows and keypad,num-columns are required.

  Required SoC Specific Properties:
  - compatible: should be "brcm,bcm-keypad"

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.

  - interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu.

  Board Specific Properties:
  - keypad,num-rows: Number of row lines connected to the keypad
    controller.

  - keypad,num-columns: Number of column lines connected to the
    keypad controller.

  - col-debounce-filter-period: The debounce period for the Column filter.

  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_1_ms	=	0
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_2_ms	=	1
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_4_ms	=	2
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_8_ms	=	3
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_16_ms	=	4
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_32_ms	=	5
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_64_ms	=	6
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_128_ms	=	7

  - status-debounce-filter-period: The debounce period for the Status filter.

  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_1_ms	=	0
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_2_ms	=	1
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_4_ms	=	2
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_8_ms	=	3
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_16_ms	=	4
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_32_ms	=	5
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_64_ms	=	6
  	KEYPAD_DEBOUNCE_128_ms	=	7

  - row-output-enabled: An optional property indicating whether the row or
    column is being used as output. If specified the row is being used
    as the output. Else defaults to column.

  - pull-up-enabled: An optional property indicating the Keypad scan mode.
    If specified implies the keypad scan pull-up has been enabled.

  - autorepeat: Boolean, Enable auto repeat feature of Linux input
  	  subsystem (optional).

  - linux,keymap: The keymap for keys as described in the binding document
    devicetree/bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt.
