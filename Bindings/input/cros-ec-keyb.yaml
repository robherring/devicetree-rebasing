  Google's ChromeOS EC Keyboard is a simple matrix keyboard implemented on
  a separate EC (Embedded Controller) device. It provides a message for reading
  key scans from the EC. These are then converted into keycodes for processing
  by the kernel.

  This binding is based on matrix-keymap.txt and extends/modifies it as follows:

             

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - const: google,cros-ec-keyb

  ChromeOS EC Keyboard

  Google's ChromeOS EC Keyboard is a simple matrix keyboard implemented on
  a separate EC (Embedded Controller) device. It provides a message for reading
  key scans from the EC. These are then converted into keycodes for processing
  by the kernel.

  This binding is based on matrix-keymap.txt and extends/modifies it as follows:

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "google,cros-ec-keyb"

  Optional properties:
  - google,needs-ghost-filter: True to enable a ghost filter for the matrix
  keyboard. This is recommended if the EC does not have its own logic or
  hardware for this.
