  * Freescale i.MX6UL Touch Controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "fsl,imx6ul-tsc".
  - reg: this touch controller address and the ADC2 address.
  - interrupts: the interrupt of this touch controller and ADC2.
  - clocks: the root clock of touch controller and ADC2.
  - clock-names; must be "tsc" and "adc".
  - xnur-gpio: the X- gpio this controller connect to.
    This xnur-gpio returns to low once the finger leave the touch screen (The
    last touch event the touch controller capture).

  Optional properties:
  - measure-delay-time: the value of measure delay time.
    Before X-axis or Y-axis measurement, the screen need some time before
    even potential distribution ready.
    This value depends on the touch screen.
  - pre-charge-time: the touch screen need some time to precharge.
    This value depends on the touch screen.
  - touchscreen-average-samples: Number of data samples which are averaged for
    each read. Valid values are 1, 4, 8, 16 and 32.
