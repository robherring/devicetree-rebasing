  PROPERTIES

  - compatible:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <string>
  	Definition: must be one of:
  		    "qcom,pm8058-pwrkey"
  		    "qcom,pm8921-pwrkey"

  - reg:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition: address of power key control register

  - interrupts:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition: the first interrupt specifies the key release interrupt
  		    and the second interrupt specifies the key press interrupt.
  		    The format of the specifier is defined by the binding
  		    document describing the node's interrupt parent.

  - debounce:
  	Usage: optional
  	Value type: <u32>
  	Definition: time in microseconds that key must be pressed or release
  		    for state change interrupt to trigger.

  - pull-up:
  	Usage: optional
  	Value type: <empty>
  	Definition: presence of this property indicates that the KPDPWR_N pin
  		    should be configured for pull up.
