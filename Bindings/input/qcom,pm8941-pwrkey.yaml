  PROPERTIES

  - compatible:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <string>
  	Definition: must be one of:
  		    "qcom,pm8941-pwrkey"

  - reg:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition: base address of registers for block

  - interrupts:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition: key change interrupt; The format of the specifier is
  		    defined by the binding document describing the node's
  		    interrupt parent.

  - debounce:
  	Usage: optional
  	Value type: <u32>
  	Definition: time in microseconds that key must be pressed or released
  		    for state change interrupt to trigger.

  - bias-pull-up:
  	Usage: optional
  	Value type: <empty>
  	Definition: presence of this property indicates that the KPDPWR_N pin
  		    should be configured for pull up.
