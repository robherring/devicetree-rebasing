  National Instruments Ettus Research USRP E3x0 button driver

  This module is part of the NI Ettus Research USRP E3x0 SDR.

  This module provides a simple power button event via two interrupts.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be one of the following
    - "ettus,e3x0-button": For devices such as the NI Ettus Research USRP E3x0
  - interrupt-parent:
    - a phandle to the interrupt controller that it is attached to.
  - interrupts: should be one of the following
    - <0 30 1>, <0 31 1>: For devices such as the NI Ettus Research USRP E3x0
  - interrupt-names: should be one of the following
    - "press", "release": For devices such as the NI Ettus Research USRP E3x0

  Note: Interrupt numbers might vary depending on the FPGA configuration.
