description: |+
  TI dra7 based SoCs such as am57xx have a controller for setting the IO delay
  for each pin. For most part the IO delay values are programmed by the bootloader,
  but some pins need to be configured dynamically by the kernel such as the
  MMC pins.

  * Pin configuration for TI IODELAY controller

  TI dra7 based SoCs such as am57xx have a controller for setting the IO delay
  for each pin. For most part the IO delay values are programmed by the bootloader,
  but some pins need to be configured dynamically by the kernel such as the
  MMC pins.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be "ti,dra7-iodelay"
    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used
    - #address-cells: Number of address cells
    - #size-cells: Size of cells
    - #pinctrl-cells: Number of pinctrl cells, must be 2. See also
