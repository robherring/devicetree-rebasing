  Pincontrol driver for RK805 Power management IC.

  RK805 has 2 pins which can be configured as GPIO output only.

  Please refer file <devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt>
  for details of the common pinctrl bindings used by client devices,
  including the meaning of the phrase "pin configuration node".

  Optional Pinmux properties:
  --------------------------
  Following properties are required if default setting of pins are required
  at boot.
  - pinctrl-names: A pinctrl state named per <pinctrl-binding.txt>.
  - pinctrl[0...n]: Properties to contain the phandle for pinctrl states per
  		<pinctrl-binding.txt>.

  The pin configurations are defined as child of the pinctrl states node. Each
  sub-node have following properties:

  Required properties:
  ------------------
  - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
    second is the GPIO flags.

  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.

  - pins: List of pins. Valid values of pins properties are: gpio0, gpio1.

  First 2 properties must be added in the RK805 PMIC node, documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rk808.txt

  Optional properties:
  -------------------
  Following are optional properties defined as pinmux DT binding document
  <pinctrl-bindings.txt>. Absence of properties will leave the configuration
  on default.
  	function,
  	output-low,
  	output-high.

  Valid values for function properties are: gpio.

  Theres is also not customised properties for any GPIO.
