  Broadcom BCM281xx Pin Controller

  This is a pin controller for the Broadcom BCM281xx SoC family, which includes
  BCM11130, BCM11140, BCM11351, BCM28145, and BCM28155 SoCs.

  === Pin Controller Node ===

  Required Properties:

  - compatible:	Must be "brcm,bcm11351-pinctrl"
  - reg:		Base address of the PAD Controller register block and the size
  		of the block.

  For example, the following is the bare minimum node:

  	pinctrl@35004800 {
  		compatible = "brcm,bcm11351-pinctrl";
  		reg = <0x35004800 0x430>;
  	};

  As a pin controller device, in addition to the required properties, this node
  should also contain the pin configuration nodes that client devices reference,
  if any.

  === Pin Configuration Node ===

  Each pin configuration node is a sub-node of the pin controller node and is a
  container of an arbitrary number of subnodes, called pin group nodes in this
  document.

  Please refer to the pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
  common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the definition of a
  "pin configuration node".

  === Pin Group Node ===

  A pin group node specifies the desired pin mux and/or pin configuration for an
  arbitrary number of pins.  The name of the pin group node is optional and not
  used.

  A pin group node only affects the properties specified in the node, and has no
  effect on any properties that are omitted.

  The pin group node accepts a subset of the generic pin config properties. For
  details generic pin config properties, please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt
  and <include/linux/pinctrl/pinconfig-generic.h>.

  Each pin controlled by this pin controller belong to one of three types:
  Standard, I2C, and HDMI.  Each type accepts a different set of pin config
  properties.  A list of pins and their types is provided below.

  Required Properties (applicable to all pins):

  - pins:		Multiple strings.  Specifies the name(s) of one or more pins to
  		be configured by this node.

  Optional Properties (for standard pins):

  - function:			String. Specifies the pin mux selection. Values
  				must be one of: "alt1", "alt2", "alt3", "alt4"
  - input-schmitt-enable:		No arguments. Enable schmitt-trigger mode.
  - input-schmitt-disable:	No arguments. Disable schmitt-trigger mode.
  - bias-pull-up:			No arguments. Pull up on pin.
  - bias-pull-down:		No arguments. Pull down on pin.
  - bias-disable:			No arguments. Disable pin bias.
  - slew-rate:			Integer. Meaning depends on configured pin mux:
  				*_SCL or *_SDA:
  					0: Standard(100kbps)& Fast(400kbps) mode
  					1: Highspeed (3.4Mbps) mode
  				IC_DM or IC_DP:
  					0: normal slew rate
  					1: fast slew rate
  				Otherwise:
  					0: fast slew rate
  					1: normal slew rate
  - input-enable:			No arguments. Enable input (does not affect
  				output.)
  - input-disable:		No arguments. Disable input (does not affect
  				output.)
  - drive-strength:		Integer. Drive strength in mA.  Valid values are
  				2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 mA.

  Optional Properties (for I2C pins):

  - function:			String. Specifies the pin mux selection. Values
  				must be one of: "alt1", "alt2", "alt3", "alt4"
  - bias-pull-up:			Integer. Pull up strength in Ohm. There are 3
  				pull-up resisitors (1.2k, 1.8k, 2.7k) available
  				in parallel for I2C pins, so the valid values
  				are: 568, 720, 831, 1080, 1200, 1800, 2700 Ohm.
  - bias-disable:			No arguments. Disable pin bias.
  - slew-rate:			Integer. Meaning depends on configured pin mux:
  				*_SCL or *_SDA:
  					0: Standard(100kbps)& Fast(400kbps) mode
  					1: Highspeed (3.4Mbps) mode
  				IC_DM or IC_DP:
  					0: normal slew rate
  					1: fast slew rate
  				Otherwise:
  					0: fast slew rate
  					1: normal slew rate
  - input-enable:			No arguments. Enable input (does not affect
  				output.)
  - input-disable:		No arguments. Disable input (does not affect
  				output.)

  Optional Properties (for HDMI pins):

  - function:			String. Specifies the pin mux selection. Values
  				must be one of: "alt1", "alt2", "alt3", "alt4"
  - slew-rate:			Integer. Controls slew rate.
  					0: Standard(100kbps)& Fast(400kbps) mode
  					1: Highspeed (3.4Mbps) mode
  - input-enable:			No arguments. Enable input (does not affect
  				output.)
  - input-disable:		No arguments. Disable input (does not affect
  				output.)
