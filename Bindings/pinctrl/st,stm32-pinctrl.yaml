  * STM32 GPIO and Pin Mux/Config controller

  STMicroelectronics's STM32 MCUs intregrate a GPIO and Pin mux/config hardware
  controller. It controls the input/output settings on the available pins and
  also provides ability to multiplex and configure the output of various on-chip
  controllers onto these pads.

  Pin controller node:
  Required properies:
   - compatible: value should be one of the following:
     "st,stm32f429-pinctrl"
     "st,stm32f469-pinctrl"
     "st,stm32f746-pinctrl"
     "st,stm32h743-pinctrl"
     "st,stm32mp157-pinctrl"
     "st,stm32mp157-z-pinctrl"
   - #address-cells: The value of this property must be 1
   - #size-cells	: The value of this property must be 1
   - ranges	: defines mapping between pin controller node (parent) to
     gpio-bank node (children).
   - pins-are-numbered: Specify the subnodes are using numbered pinmux to
     specify pins.

  GPIO controller/bank node:
  Required properties:
   - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller
   - #gpio-cells	  : Should be two.
  			The first cell is the pin number
  			The second one is the polarity:
  				- 0 for active high
  				- 1 for active low
   - reg		  : The gpio address range, relative to the pinctrl range
   - clocks	  : clock that drives this bank
   - st,bank-name	  : Should be a name string for this bank as specified in
     the datasheet

  Optional properties:
   - reset:	  : Reference to the reset controller
   - interrupt-parent: phandle of the interrupt parent to which the external
     GPIO interrupts are forwarded to.
   - st,syscfg: Should be phandle/offset pair. The phandle to the syscon node
     which includes IRQ mux selection register, and the offset of the IRQ mux
     selection register.
   - gpio-ranges: Define a dedicated mapping between a pin-controller and
     a gpio controller. Format is <&phandle a b c> with:
  	-(phandle): phandle of pin-controller.
  	-(a): gpio base offset in range.
  	-(b): pin base offset in range.
  	-(c): gpio count in range
     This entry has to be used either if there are holes inside a bank:
  	GPIOB0/B1/B2/B14/B15 (see example 2)
     or if banks are not contiguous:
  	GPIOA/B/C/E...
     NOTE: If "gpio-ranges" is used for a gpio controller, all gpio-controller
     have to use a "gpio-ranges" entry.
     More details in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
