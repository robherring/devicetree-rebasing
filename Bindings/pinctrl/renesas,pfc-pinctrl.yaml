  * Renesas Pin Function Controller (GPIO and Pin Mux/Config)

  The Pin Function Controller (PFC) is a Pin Mux/Config controller. On SH73A0,
  R8A73A4 and R8A7740 it also acts as a GPIO controller.


  Pin Control

      - "renesas,pfc-r8a7792": for R8A7792 (R-Car V2H) compatible pin-controller.
      - "renesas,pfc-r8a7793": for R8A7793 (R-Car M2-N) compatible pin-controller.
      - "renesas,pfc-r8a7794": for R8A7794 (R-Car E2) compatible pin-controller.
      - "renesas,pfc-r8a7795": for R8A7795 (R-Car H3) compatible pin-controller.
      - "renesas,pfc-r8a7796": for R8A7796 (R-Car M3-W) compatible pin-controller.
      - "renesas,pfc-r8a77970": for R8A77970 (R-Car V3M) compatible pin-controller.
      - "renesas,pfc-r8a77995": for R8A77995 (R-Car D3) compatible pin-controller.
      - "renesas,pfc-sh73a0": for SH73A0 (SH-Mobile AG5) compatible pin-controller.

    - reg: Base address and length of each memory resource used by the pin
      controller hardware module.

  Optional properties:

    - #gpio-range-cells: Mandatory when the PFC doesn't handle GPIO, forbidden
      otherwise. Should be 3.

    - interrupts-extended: Specify the interrupts associated with external
      IRQ pins. This property is mandatory when the PFC handles GPIOs and
      forbidden otherwise. When specified, it must contain one interrupt per
      external IRQ, sorted by external IRQ number.

  The PFC node also acts as a container for pin configuration nodes. Please refer
  to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for the definition of the term "pin
  configuration node" and for the common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.

  Each pin configuration node represents a desired configuration for a pin, a
  pin group, or a list of pins or pin groups. The configuration can include the
  function to select on those pin(s) and pin configuration parameters (such as
  pull-up and pull-down).

  Pin configuration nodes contain pin configuration properties, either directly
  or grouped in child subnodes. Both pin muxing and configuration parameters can
  be grouped in that way and referenced as a single pin configuration node by
  client devices.

  A configuration node or subnode must reference at least one pin (through the
  pins or pin groups properties) and contain at least a function or one
  configuration parameter. When the function is present only pin groups can be
  used to reference pins.

  All pin configuration nodes and subnodes names are ignored. All of those nodes
  are parsed through phandles and processed purely based on their content.

  Pin Configuration Node Properties:

  - pins : An array of strings, each string containing the name of a pin.
  - groups : An array of strings, each string containing the name of a pin
    group.

  - function: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the pin
    group(s) specified by the groups property.

    Valid values for pin, group and function names can be found in the group and
    function arrays of the PFC data file corresponding to the SoC
    (drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-*.c)

  The pin configuration parameters use the generic pinconf bindings defined in
  pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory. The supported parameters are
  bias-disable, bias-pull-up, bias-pull-down, drive-strength and power-source. For
  pins that have a configurable I/O voltage, the power-source value should be the
  nominal I/O voltage in millivolts.


  GPIO
  ----

  On SH73A0, R8A73A4 and R8A7740 the PFC node is also a GPIO controller node.

  Required Properties:

    - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.

    - #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the second
      cell specifies GPIO flags, as defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>. Only the
      GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flags are supported.

  The syntax of the gpio specifier used by client nodes should be the following
  with values derived from the SoC user manual.

    <[phandle of the gpio controller node]
     [pin number within the gpio controller]
     [flags]>

  On other mach-shmobile platforms GPIO is handled by the gpio-rcar driver.
  Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/renesas,gpio-rcar.txt
  for documentation of the GPIO device tree bindings on those platforms.
