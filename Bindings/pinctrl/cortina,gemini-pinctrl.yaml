  Cortina Systems Gemini pin controller

  This pin controller is found in the Cortina Systems Gemini SoC family,
  see further arm/gemini.txt. It is a purely group-based multiplexing pin
  controller.

  The pin controller node must be a subnode of the system controller node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "cortina,gemini-pinctrl"

  Subnodes of the pin controller contain pin control multiplexing set-up
  and pin configuration of individual pins.

  Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt for generic pin multiplexing nodes
  and generic pin config nodes.

  Supported configurations:
  - skew-delay is supported on the Ethernet pins
  - drive-strength with 4, 8, 12 or 16 mA as argument is supported for
    entire groups on the groups "idegrp", "gmii_gmac0_grp", "gmii_gmac1_grp"
    and "pcigrp".
