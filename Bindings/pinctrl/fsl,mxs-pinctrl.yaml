  * Freescale MXS Pin Controller

  The pins controlled by mxs pin controller are organized in banks, each bank
  has 32 pins.  Each pin has 4 multiplexing functions, and generally, the 4th
  function is GPIO.  The configuration on the pins includes drive strength,
  voltage and pull-up.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "fsl,imx23-pinctrl" or "fsl,imx28-pinctrl"
  - reg: Should contain the register physical address and length for the
    pin controller.

  Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
  common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.

  The node of mxs pin controller acts as a container for an arbitrary number of
  subnodes.  Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for
  a group of pins, and only affects those parameters that are explicitly listed.
  In other words, a subnode that describes a drive strength parameter implies no
  information about pull-up. For this reason, even seemingly boolean values are
  actually tristates in this binding: unspecified, off, or on. Unspecified is
  represented as an absent property, and off/on are represented as integer
  values 0 and 1.

  Those subnodes under mxs pin controller node will fall into two categories.
  One is to set up a group of pins for a function, both mux selection and pin
  configurations, and it's called group node in the binding document.   The other
  one is to adjust the pin configuration for some particular pins that need a
  different configuration than what is defined in group node.  The binding
  document calls this type of node config node.

  On mxs, there is no hardware pin group. The pin group in this binding only
  means a group of pins put together for particular peripheral to work in
  particular function, like SSP0 functioning as mmc0-8bit.  That said, the
  group node should include all the pins needed for one function rather than
  having these pins defined in several group nodes.  It also means each of
  "pinctrl-*" phandle in client device node should only have one group node
  pointed in there, while the phandle can have multiple config node referenced
  there to adjust configurations for some pins in the group.

  Required subnode-properties:
  - fsl,pinmux-ids: An integer array.  Each integer in the array specify a pin
    with given mux function, with bank, pin and mux packed as below.

      [15..12] : bank number
      [11..4]  : pin number
      [3..0]   : mux selection

    This integer with mux selection packed is used as an entity by both group
    and config nodes to identify a pin.  The mux selection in the integer takes
    effects only on group node, and will get ignored by driver with config node,
    since config node is only meant to set up pin configurations.

    Valid values for these integers are listed below.

  - reg: Should be the index of the group nodes for same function.  This property
    is required only for group nodes, and should not be present in any config
    nodes.

  Optional subnode-properties:
  - fsl,drive-strength: Integer.
      0: MXS_DRIVE_4mA
      1: MXS_DRIVE_8mA
      2: MXS_DRIVE_12mA
      3: MXS_DRIVE_16mA
  - fsl,voltage: Integer.
      0: MXS_VOLTAGE_LOW  - 1.8 V
      1: MXS_VOLTAGE_HIGH - 3.3 V
  - fsl,pull-up: Integer.
      0: MXS_PULL_DISABLE - Disable the internal pull-up
      1: MXS_PULL_ENABLE  - Enable the internal pull-up

  Note that when enabling the pull-up, the internal pad keeper gets disabled.
  Also, some pins doesn't have a pull up, in that case, setting the fsl,pull-up
  will only disable the internal pad keeper.
