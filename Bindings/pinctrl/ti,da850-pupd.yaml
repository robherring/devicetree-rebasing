  * Pin configuration for TI DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18x

  These SoCs have a separate controller for setting bias (internal pullup/down).
  Bias can only be selected for groups rather than individual pins.

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: Must be "ti,da850-pupd"
    - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the pullup/down
      controller hardware module.

  The controller node also acts as a container for pin group configuration nodes.
  The names of these groups are ignored.

  Pin Group Node Properties:

  - groups: An array of strings, each string containing the name of a pin group.
            Valid names are "cp0".."cp31".

  The pin configuration parameters use the generic pinconf bindings defined in
  pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory. The supported parameters are
  bias-disable, bias-pull-up, bias-pull-down.
