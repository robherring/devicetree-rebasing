  The pin controller on ZTE ZX platforms is kinda of hybrid.  It consists of
  a main controller and an auxiliary one.  For example, on ZX296718 SoC, the
  main controller is TOP_PMM and the auxiliary one is AON_IOCFG.  Both
  controllers work together to control pin multiplexing and configuration in
  the way illustrated as below.

  For most of pins like GMII_RXD3 in the figure, the pinmux function is
  controlled by TOP_PMM block only, and this type of pins are meant by term
  'TOP pins'.  For pins like KEY_ROW2, the pinmux is controlled by both
  TOP_PMM and AON_IOCFG blocks, as the available multiplexing functions for
  the pin spread in both controllers.  This type of pins are called 'AON pins'.
  Though pinmux implementation is quite different, pinconf is same for both
  types of pins.  Both are controlled by auxiliary controller, i.e. AON_IOCFG
  on ZX296718.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "zte,zx296718-pmm".
  - reg: the register physical address and length.
  - zte,auxiliary-controller: phandle to the auxiliary pin controller which
    implements pinmux for AON pins and pinconf for all pins.

  The following pin configuration are supported. Please refer to
  pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for more details of the common
  pinctrl bindings used by client devices.

  - bias-pull-up
  - bias-pull-down
  - drive-strength
  - input-enable
  - slew-rate
