  * Allwinner A1X Pin Controller

  The pins controlled by sunXi pin controller are organized in banks,
  each bank has 32 pins.  Each pin has 7 multiplexing functions, with
  the first two functions being GPIO in and out. The configuration on
  the pins includes drive strength and pull-up.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of the following (depending on your SoC):
    "allwinner,sun4i-a10-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun5i-a10s-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun5i-a13-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun6i-a31-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun6i-a31s-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun6i-a31-r-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun7i-a20-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-a23-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-a23-r-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-a33-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun9i-a80-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun9i-a80-r-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-r-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-h3-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-h3-r-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun8i-r40-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun50i-a64-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun50i-a64-r-pinctrl"
    "allwinner,sun50i-h5-pinctrl"
    "nextthing,gr8-pinctrl"

  - reg: Should contain the register physical address and length for the
    pin controller.

  - clocks: phandle to the clocks feeding the pin controller:
    - "apb": the gated APB parent clock
    - "hosc": the high frequency oscillator in the system
    - "losc": the low frequency oscillator in the system

  Note: For backward compatibility reasons, the hosc and losc clocks are only
  required if you need to use the optional input-debounce property. Any new
  device tree should set them.

  Optional properties:
    - input-debounce: Array of debouncing periods in microseconds. One period per
      irq bank found in the controller. 0 if no setup required.


  Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
  common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.

  A pinctrl node should contain at least one subnodes representing the
  pinctrl groups available on the machine. Each subnode will list the
  pins it needs, and how they should be configured, with regard to muxer
  configuration, drive strength and pullups. If one of these options is
  not set, its actual value will be unspecified.

  This driver supports the generic pin multiplexing and configuration
  bindings. For details on each properties, you can refer to
  ./pinctrl-bindings.txt.

  Required sub-node properties:
    - pins
    - function

  Optional sub-node properties:
    - bias-disable
    - bias-pull-up
    - bias-pull-down
    - drive-strength

  *** Deprecated pin configuration and multiplexing binding

  Required subnode-properties:

  - allwinner,pins: List of strings containing the pin name.
  - allwinner,function: Function to mux the pins listed above to.

  Optional subnode-properties:
  - allwinner,drive: Integer. Represents the current sent to the pin
      0: 10 mA
      1: 20 mA
      2: 30 mA
      3: 40 mA
  - allwinner,pull: Integer.
      0: No resistor
      1: Pull-up resistor
      2: Pull-down resistor
