description: |+
  The Renesas SoCs of the RZ/A1 family feature a combined Pin and GPIO controller,
  named "Ports" in the hardware reference manual.
  Pin multiplexing and GPIO configuration is performed on a per-pin basis
  writing configuration values to per-port register sets.
  Each "port" features up to 16 pins, each of them configurable for GPIO
  function (port mode) or in alternate function mode.
  Up to 8 different alternate function modes exist for each single pin.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: should be:
      - "renesas,r7s72100-ports": for RZ/A1H
      - "renesas,r7s72101-ports", "renesas,r7s72100-ports": for RZ/A1M
      - "renesas,r7s72102-ports": for RZ/A1L

    - reg
      address base and length of the memory area where the pin controller
      hardware is mapped to.
