  Binding for the CPLD LEDs (GPIO extension bus) found on some LaCie/Seagate
  boards (Example: 2Big/5Big Network v2, 2Big NAS).

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "lacie,netxbig-leds".
  - gpio-ext: Phandle for the gpio-ext bus.

  Optional properties:
  - timers: Timer array. Each timer entry is represented by three integers:
    Mode (gpio-ext bus), delay_on and delay_off.

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the netxbig-leds device.

  Required sub-node properties:
  - mode-addr: Mode register address on gpio-ext bus.
  - mode-val: Mode to value mapping. Each entry is represented by two integers:
    A mode and the corresponding value on the gpio-ext bus.
  - bright-addr: Brightness register address on gpio-ext bus.
  - max-brightness: Maximum brightness value.

  Optional sub-node properties:
  - label: Name for this LED. If omitted, the label is taken from the node name.
  - linux,default-trigger: Trigger assigned to the LED.
