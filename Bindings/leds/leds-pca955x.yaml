description: |+
  The PCA955x family of chips are I2C LED blinkers whose pins not used
  to control LEDs can be used as general purpose I/Os. The GPIO pins can
  be input or output, and output pins can also be pulse-width controlled.

  * NXP - pca955x LED driver

  The PCA955x family of chips are I2C LED blinkers whose pins not used
  to control LEDs can be used as general purpose I/Os. The GPIO pins can
  be input or output, and output pins can also be pulse-width controlled.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be one of :
  	"nxp,pca9550"
  	"nxp,pca9551"
  	"nxp,pca9552"
  	"nxp,pca9553"
  - #address-cells: must be 1
  - #size-cells: must be 0
  - reg: I2C slave address. depends on the model.

  Optional properties:
  - gpio-controller: allows pins to be used as GPIOs.
  - #gpio-cells: must be 2.
  - gpio-line-names: define the names of the GPIO lines

  LED sub-node properties:
  - reg : number of LED line.
  		from 0 to  1 for the pca9550
  		from 0 to  7 for the pca9551
  		from 0 to 15 for the pca9552
  		from 0 to  3 for the pca9553
  - type: (optional) either
  	PCA9532_TYPE_NONE
  	PCA9532_TYPE_LED
  	PCA9532_TYPE_GPIO
  	see dt-bindings/leds/leds-pca955x.h (default to LED)
  - label : (optional)
  	see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - linux,default-trigger : (optional)
  	see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
