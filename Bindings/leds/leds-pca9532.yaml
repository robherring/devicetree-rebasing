  *NXP - pca9532 PWM LED Driver

  The PCA9532 family is SMBus I/O expander optimized for dimming LEDs.
  The PWM support 256 steps.

  Required properties:
  	- compatible:
  		"nxp,pca9530"
  		"nxp,pca9531"
  		"nxp,pca9532"
  		"nxp,pca9533"
  	- reg -  I2C slave address

  Each led is represented as a sub-node of the nxp,pca9530.

  Optional sub-node properties:
  	- label: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  	- type: Output configuration, see dt-bindings/leds/leds-pca9532.h (default NONE)
  	- linux,default-trigger: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  	- default-state: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  	  This property is only valid for sub-nodes of type <PCA9532_TYPE_LED>.
