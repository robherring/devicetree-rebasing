  Register bit leds are used with syscon multifunctional devices
  where single bits in a certain register can turn on/off a
  single LED. The register bit LEDs appear as children to the
  syscon device, with the proper compatible string. For the
  syscon bindings see:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.txt

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the syscon device. Each
  node's name represents the name of the corresponding LED.

  Device Tree Bindings for Register Bit LEDs

  Register bit leds are used with syscon multifunctional devices
  where single bits in a certain register can turn on/off a
  single LED. The register bit LEDs appear as children to the
  syscon device, with the proper compatible string. For the
  syscon bindings see:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.txt

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the syscon device. Each
  node's name represents the name of the corresponding LED.

  LED sub-node properties:

  Required properties:
  - compatible : must be "register-bit-led"
  - offset : register offset to the register controlling this LED
  - mask : bit mask for the bit controlling this LED in the register
    typically 0x01, 0x02, 0x04 ...

  Optional properties:
  - label : (optional)
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - linux,default-trigger : (optional)
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - default-state: (optional) The initial state of the LED
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
