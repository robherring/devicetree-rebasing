  LEDs connected to GPIO lines

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "gpio-leds".

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the gpio-leds device.  Each
  node's name represents the name of the corresponding LED.

  LED sub-node properties:
  - gpios :  Should specify the LED's GPIO, see "gpios property" in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.  Active low LEDs should be
    indicated using flags in the GPIO specifier.
  - label :  (optional)
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - linux,default-trigger :  (optional)
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - default-state:  (optional) The initial state of the LED.
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - retain-state-suspended: (optional) The suspend state can be retained.Such
    as charge-led gpio.
  - retain-state-shutdown: (optional) Retain the state of the LED on shutdown.
    Useful in BMC systems, for example when the BMC is rebooted while the host
    remains up.
  - panic-indicator : (optional)
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
