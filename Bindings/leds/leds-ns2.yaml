  Binding for dual-GPIO LED found on Network Space v2 (and parents).

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "lacie,ns2-leds".

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the ns2-leds device.

  Required sub-node properties:
  - cmd-gpio: Command LED GPIO. See OF device-tree GPIO specification.
  - slow-gpio: Slow LED GPIO. See OF device-tree GPIO specification.
  - modes-map: A mapping between LED modes (off, on or SATA activity blinking) and
    the corresponding cmd-gpio/slow-gpio values. All the GPIO values combinations
    should be given in order to avoid having an unknown mode at driver probe time.

  Optional sub-node properties:
  - label: Name for this LED. If omitted, the label is taken from the node name.
  - linux,default-trigger: Trigger assigned to the LED.
