description: |+
  KTD2692 is the ideal power solution for high-power flash LEDs.
  It uses ExpressWire single-wire programming for maximum flexibility.

  The ExpressWire interface through CTRL pin can control LED on/off and
  enable/disable the IC, Movie(max 1/3 of Flash current) / Flash mode current,
  Flash timeout, LVP(low voltage protection).

  Also, When the AUX pin is pulled high while CTRL pin is high,
  LED current will be ramped up to the flash-mode current level.

  * Kinetic Technologies - KTD2692 Flash LED Driver

  KTD2692 is the ideal power solution for high-power flash LEDs.
  It uses ExpressWire single-wire programming for maximum flexibility.

  The ExpressWire interface through CTRL pin can control LED on/off and
  enable/disable the IC, Movie(max 1/3 of Flash current) / Flash mode current,
  Flash timeout, LVP(low voltage protection).

  Also, When the AUX pin is pulled high while CTRL pin is high,
  LED current will be ramped up to the flash-mode current level.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "kinetic,ktd2692".
  - ctrl-gpios : Specifier of the GPIO connected to CTRL pin.
  - aux-gpios : Specifier of the GPIO connected to AUX pin.

  Optional properties:
  - vin-supply : "vin" LED supply (2.7V to 5.5V).
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  A discrete LED element connected to the device must be represented by a child
  node - See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

  Required properties for flash LED child nodes:
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - led-max-microamp : Minimum Threshold for Timer protection
    is defined internally (Maximum 300mA).
  - flash-max-microamp : Flash LED maximum current
    Formula : I(mA) = 15000 / Rset.
  - flash-max-timeout-us : Flash LED maximum timeout.

  Optional properties for flash LED child nodes:
  - label : See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
