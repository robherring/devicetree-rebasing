description: |+
  This controller is present on BCM6358 and BCM6368.
  In these SoCs there are Serial LEDs (LEDs connected to a 74x164 controller),
  which can either be controlled by software (exporting the 74x164 as spi-gpio.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio-74x164.txt), or
  by hardware using this driver.

  LEDs connected to Broadcom BCM6358 controller

  This controller is present on BCM6358 and BCM6368.
  In these SoCs there are Serial LEDs (LEDs connected to a 74x164 controller),
  which can either be controlled by software (exporting the 74x164 as spi-gpio.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio-74x164.txt), or
  by hardware using this driver.

  Required properties:
    - compatible : should be "brcm,bcm6358-leds".
    - #address-cells : must be 1.
    - #size-cells : must be 0.
    - reg : BCM6358 LED controller address and size.

  Optional properties:
    - brcm,clk-div : SCK signal divider. Possible values are 1, 2, 4 and 8.
      Default : 1
    - brcm,clk-dat-low : Boolean, makes clock and data signals active low.
      Default : false

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the brcm,bcm6358-leds device.

  LED sub-node required properties:
    - reg : LED pin number (only LEDs 0 to 31 are valid).

  LED sub-node optional properties:
    - label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
    - active-low : Boolean, makes LED active low.
      Default : false
    - default-state : see
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
    - linux,default-trigger : see
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
