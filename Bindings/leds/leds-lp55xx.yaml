  Binding for TI/National Semiconductor LP55xx Led Drivers

  Required properties:
  - compatible: one of
  	national,lp5521
  	national,lp5523
  	ti,lp55231
  	ti,lp5562
  	ti,lp8501

  - reg: I2C slave address
  - clock-mode: Input clock mode, (0: automode, 1: internal, 2: external)

  Each child has own specific current settings
  - led-cur: Current setting at each led channel (mA x10, 0 if led is not connected)
  - max-cur: Maximun current at each led channel.

  Optional properties:
  - enable-gpio: GPIO attached to the chip's enable pin
  - label: Used for naming LEDs
  - pwr-sel: LP8501 specific property. Power selection for output channels.
           0: D1~9 are connected to VDD
           1: D1~6 with VDD, D7~9 with VOUT
           2: D1~6 with VOUT, D7~9 with VDD
           3: D1~9 are connected to VOUT

  Alternatively, each child can have a specific channel name and trigger:
  - chan-name (optional): name of channel
  - linux,default-trigger (optional): see
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
