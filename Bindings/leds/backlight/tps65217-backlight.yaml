  TPS65217 family of regulators

  The TPS65217 chip contains a boost converter and current sinks which can be
  used to drive LEDs for use as backlights.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "ti,tps65217"
  - reg: I2C slave address
  - backlight: node for specifying WLED1 and WLED2 lines in TPS65217
  - isel: selection bit, valid values: 1 for ISEL1 (low-level) and 2 for ISEL2 (high-level)
  - fdim: PWM dimming frequency, valid values: 100, 200, 500, 1000
  - default-brightness: valid values: 0-100

  Each regulator is defined using the standard binding for regulators.
