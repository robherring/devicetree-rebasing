  LED connected to PWM

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "pwm-leds".

  Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the pwm-leds device.  Each
  node's name represents the name of the corresponding LED.

  LED sub-node properties:
  - pwms : PWM property to point to the PWM device (phandle)/port (id) and to
    specify the period time to be used: <&phandle id period_ns>;
  - pwm-names : (optional) Name to be used by the PWM subsystem for the PWM device
    For the pwms and pwm-names property please refer to:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
  - max-brightness : Maximum brightness possible for the LED
  - active-low : (optional) For PWMs where the LED is wired to supply
    rather than ground.
  - label :  (optional)
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - linux,default-trigger :  (optional)
    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
