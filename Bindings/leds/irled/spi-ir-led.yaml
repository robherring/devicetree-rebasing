  Device tree bindings for IR LED connected through SPI bus which is used as
  remote controller.

  The IR LED switch is connected to the MOSI line of the SPI device and the data
  are delivered thourgh that.

  Required properties:
  	- compatible: should be "ir-spi-led".

  Optional properties:
  	- duty-cycle: 8 bit balue that represents the percentage of one period
  	  in which the signal is active.  It can be 50, 60, 70, 75, 80 or 90.
  	- led-active-low: boolean value that specifies whether the output is
  	  negated with a NOT gate.
  	- power-supply: specifies the power source. It can either be a regulator
  	  or a gpio which enables a regulator, i.e. a regulator-fixed as
  	  described in
  	  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/fixed-regulator.txt
