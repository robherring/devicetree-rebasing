  Device tree bindings for IR LED connected through gpio pin which is used as
  remote controller transmitter.

  Required properties:
  	- compatible: should be "gpio-ir-tx".
  	- gpios :  Should specify the IR LED GPIO, see "gpios property" in
  	  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.  Active low LEDs
  	  should be indicated using flags in the GPIO specifier.
