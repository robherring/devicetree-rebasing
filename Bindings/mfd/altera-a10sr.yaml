  * Altera Arria10 Development Kit System Resource Chip

  Required parent device properties:
  - compatible		: "altr,a10sr"
  - spi-max-frequency	: Maximum SPI frequency.
  - reg			: The SPI Chip Select address for the Arria10
  			  System Resource chip
  - interrupt-parent	: The parent interrupt controller.
  - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
  - interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
  - #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, should be 2.
  			    The first cell is the IRQ number.
  			    The second cell is the flags, encoded as trigger
  			    masks from ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.

  The A10SR consists of these sub-devices:

  Device                   Description
  ------                   ----------
  a10sr_gpio               GPIO Controller
  a10sr_rst                Reset Controller

  Arria10 GPIO
  Required Properties:
  - compatible        : Should be "altr,a10sr-gpio"
  - gpio-controller   : Marks the device node as a GPIO Controller.
  - #gpio-cells       : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
                        the second cell is used to specify flags.
                        See ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.

  Arria10 Peripheral PHY Reset
  Required Properties:
  - compatible        : Should be "altr,a10sr-reset"
  - #reset-cells      : Should be one.
