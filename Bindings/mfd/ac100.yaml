  X-Powers AC100 Codec/RTC IC Device Tree bindings

  AC100 is a audio codec and RTC subsystem combo IC. The 2 parts are
  separated, including power supplies and interrupt lines, but share
  a common register address space and host interface.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "x-powers,ac100"
  - reg: The I2C slave address or RSB hardware address for the chip
  - sub-nodes:
    - codec
      - compatible:		"x-powers,ac100-codec"
      - interrupt-parent:		The parent interrupt controller
      - interrupts:		SoC NMI / GPIO interrupt connected to the
      				IRQ_AUDIO pin
      - #clock-cells:		Shall be 0
      - clock-output-names:	"4M_adda"

      - see clock/clock-bindings.txt for common clock bindings

    - rtc
      - compatible:		"x-powers,ac100-rtc"
      - interrupt-parent:		The parent interrupt controller
      - interrupts:		SoC NMI / GPIO interrupt connected to the
      				IRQ_RTC pin
      - clocks:			A phandle to the codec's "4M_adda" clock
      - #clock-cells:		Shall be 1
      - clock-output-names:	"cko1_rtc", "cko2_rtc", "cko3_rtc"

      - see clock/clock-bindings.txt for common clock bindings
