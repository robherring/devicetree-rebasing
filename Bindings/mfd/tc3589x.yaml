  * Toshiba TC3589x multi-purpose expander

  The Toshiba TC3589x series are I2C-based MFD devices which may expose the
  following built-in devices: gpio, keypad, rotator (vibrator), PWM (for
  e.g. LEDs or vibrators) The included models are:

  - TC35890
  - TC35892
  - TC35893
  - TC35894
  - TC35895
  - TC35896

  Required properties:
   - compatible : must be "toshiba,tc35890", "toshiba,tc35892", "toshiba,tc35893",
     "toshiba,tc35894", "toshiba,tc35895" or "toshiba,tc35896"
   - reg : I2C address of the device
   - interrupt-parent : specifies which IRQ controller we're connected to
   - interrupts : the interrupt on the parent the controller is connected to
   - interrupt-controller : marks the device node as an interrupt controller
   - #interrupt-cells : should be <1>, the first cell is the IRQ offset on this
     TC3589x interrupt controller.

  Optional nodes:

  - GPIO
    This GPIO module inside the TC3589x has 24 (TC35890, TC35892) or 20
    (other models) GPIO lines.
   - compatible : must be "toshiba,tc3589x-gpio"
   - interrupts : interrupt on the parent, which must be the tc3589x MFD device
   - interrupt-controller : marks the device node as an interrupt controller
   - #interrupt-cells : should be <2>, the first cell is the IRQ offset on this
     TC3589x GPIO interrupt controller, the second cell is the interrupt flags
     in accordance with <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>. The following
     flags are valid:
     - IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW
     - IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
     - IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
     - IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING
     - IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH
   - gpio-controller : marks the device node as a GPIO controller
   - #gpio-cells : should be <2>, the first cell is the GPIO offset on this
     GPIO controller, the second cell is the flags.

  - Keypad
    This keypad is the same on all variants, supporting up to 96 different
    keys. The linux-specific properties are modeled on those already existing
    in other input drivers.
   - compatible : must be "toshiba,tc3589x-keypad"
   - debounce-delay-ms : debounce interval in milliseconds
   - keypad,num-rows : number of rows in the matrix, see
     bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt
   - keypad,num-columns : number of columns in the matrix, see
     bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt
   - linux,keymap: the definition can be found in
     bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt
   - linux,no-autorepeat: do no enable autorepeat feature.
   - wakeup-source: use any event on keypad as wakeup event.
