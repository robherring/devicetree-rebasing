title: Broadcom iProc Multi Host Bridge (MHB)

maintainers:
  - Ray Jui <ray.jui@broadcom.com>
description: |+
  Certain Broadcom iProc SoCs have a multi host bridge (MHB) block that controls
  the connection and configuration of 1) internal PCIe serdes; 2) PCIe endpoint
  interface; 3) access to the Nitro (network processing) engine

  This node allows access to these MHB registers via syscon.

             

properties:
  compatible: {}
examples:
  - |
    mhb: syscon@60401000 {
      compatible = "brcm,sr-mhb", "syscon";
      reg = <0 0x60401000 0 0x38c>;
    };

  interface; 3) access to the Nitro (network processing) engine

  This node allows access to these MHB registers via syscon.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should contain:
  		"brcm,sr-mhb", "syscon" for Stingray
  - reg: base address and range of the MHB registers
