  Texas Instruments TWL family (twl4030) reset and power management module

  The power management module inside the TWL family provides several facilities
  to control the power resources, including power scripts. For now, the
  binding only supports the complete shutdown of the system after poweroff.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : must be one of the following
  	"ti,twl4030-power"
  	"ti,twl4030-power-reset"
  	"ti,twl4030-power-idle"
  	"ti,twl4030-power-idle-osc-off"

  The use of ti,twl4030-power-reset is recommended at least on
  3530 that needs a special configuration for warm reset to work.

  When using ti,twl4030-power-idle, the TI recommended configuration
  for idle modes is loaded to the tlw4030 PMIC.

  When using ti,twl4030-power-idle-osc-off, the TI recommended
  configuration is used with the external oscillator being shut
  down during off-idle. Note that this does not work on all boards
  depending on how the external oscillator is wired.

  Optional properties:

  - ti,system-power-controller: This indicates that TWL4030 is the
    power supply master of the system. With this flag, the chip will
    initiate an ACTIVE-to-OFF or SLEEP-to-OFF transition when the
    system poweroffs.

  - ti,use_poweroff: Deprecated name for ti,system-power-controller
