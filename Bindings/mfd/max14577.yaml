  Maxim MAX14577/77836 Multi-Function Device

  MAX14577 is a Multi-Function Device with Micro-USB Interface Circuit, Li+
  Battery Charger and SFOUT LDO output for powering USB devices. It is
  interfaced to host controller using I2C.

  MAX77836 additionally contains PMIC (with two LDO regulators) and Fuel Gauge.


  Required properties:
  - compatible : Must be "maxim,max14577" or "maxim,max77836".
  - reg : I2C slave address for the max14577 chip (0x25 for max14577/max77836)
  - interrupts : IRQ line for the chip.
  - interrupt-parent :  The parent interrupt controller.


  Required nodes:
   - charger :
  	Node for configuring the charger driver.
  	Required properties:
  		- compatible : "maxim,max14577-charger"
  			or "maxim,max77836-charger"
  		- maxim,fast-charge-uamp : Current in uA for Fast Charge;
  			Valid values:
  			- for max14577: 90000 - 950000;
  			- for max77836: 45000 - 475000;
  		- maxim,eoc-uamp : Current in uA for End-Of-Charge mode;
  			Valid values:
  			- for max14577: 50000 - 200000;
  			- for max77836: 5000 - 100000;
  		- maxim,ovp-uvolt : OverVoltage Protection Threshold in uV;
  			In an overvoltage condition, INT asserts and charging
  			stops. Valid values:
  			- 6000000, 6500000, 7000000, 7500000;
  		- maxim,constant-uvolt : Battery Constant Voltage in uV;
  			Valid values:
  			- 4000000 - 4280000 (step by 20000);
  			- 4350000;


  Optional nodes:
  - max14577-muic/max77836-muic :
  	Node used only by extcon consumers.
  	Required properties:
  		- compatible : "maxim,max14577-muic" or "maxim,max77836-muic"

  - regulators :
  	Required properties:
  		- compatible : "maxim,max14577-regulator"
  			or "maxim,max77836-regulator"

  	May contain a sub-node per regulator from the list below. Each
  	sub-node should contain the constraints and initialization information
  	for that regulator. See regulator.txt for a description of standard
  	properties for these sub-nodes.

  	List of valid regulator names:
  	- for max14577: CHARGER, SAFEOUT.
  	- for max77836: CHARGER, SAFEOUT, LDO1, LDO2.

  	The SAFEOUT is a fixed voltage regulator so there is no need to specify
  	voltages for it.
