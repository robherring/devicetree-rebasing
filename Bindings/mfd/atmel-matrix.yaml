  * Device tree bindings for Atmel Bus Matrix

  The Bus Matrix registers are used to configure Atmel SoCs internal bus
  behavior (master/slave priorities, undefined burst length type, ...)

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Should be one of the following
  			"atmel,at91sam9260-matrix", "syscon"
  			"atmel,at91sam9261-matrix", "syscon"
  			"atmel,at91sam9263-matrix", "syscon"
  			"atmel,at91sam9rl-matrix", "syscon"
  			"atmel,at91sam9g45-matrix", "syscon"
  			"atmel,at91sam9n12-matrix", "syscon"
  			"atmel,at91sam9x5-matrix", "syscon"
  			"atmel,sama5d3-matrix", "syscon"
  - reg:			Contains offset/length value of the Bus Matrix
  			memory region.

...
