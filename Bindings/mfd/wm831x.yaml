  Cirrus Logic/Wolfson Microelectronics wm831x PMICs

  System PMICs with a wide range of additional features.

  Required properties:

    - compatible : One of the following chip-specific strings:
          "wlf,wm8310"
          "wlf,wm8311"
          "wlf,wm8312"
          "wlf,wm8320"
          "wlf,wm8321"
          "wlf,wm8325"
          "wlf,wm8326"

    - reg : I2C slave address when connected using I2C, chip select number
      when using SPI.

    - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.
    - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number and the
      second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).

    - interrupts : The interrupt line the IRQ signal for the device is
      connected to.
    - interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

    - interrupt-controller : wm831x devices contain interrupt controllers and
      may provide interrupt services to other devices.
    - #interrupt-cells: Must be 2. The first cell is the IRQ number, and the
      second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
      ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

  Optional sub-nodes:
    - phys : Contains a phandle to the USB PHY.
    - regulators : Contains sub-nodes for each of the regulators supplied by
      the device. The regulators are bound using their names listed below:

      dcdc1 : DCDC1
      dcdc2 : DCDC2
      dcdc3 : DCDC3
      dcdc4 : DCDC3
      isink1 : ISINK1
      isink2 : ISINK2
      ldo1 : LDO1
      ldo2 : LDO2
      ldo3 : LDO3
      ldo4 : LDO4
      ldo5 : LDO5
      ldo7 : LDO7
      ldo11 : LDO11

      The bindings details of each regulator can be found in:
      ../regulator/regulator.txt
