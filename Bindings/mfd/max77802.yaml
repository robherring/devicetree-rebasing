description: |+
  The Maxim MAX77802 is a Power Management IC (PMIC) that contains 10 high
  efficiency Buck regulators, 32 Low-DropOut (LDO) regulators used to power
  up application processors and peripherals, a 2-channel 32kHz clock outputs,
  a Real-Time-Clock (RTC) and a I2C interface to program the individual
  regulators, clocks outputs and the RTC.

  Bindings for the built-in 32k clock generator block and
  regulators are defined in ../clk/maxim,max77802.txt and
  ../regulator/max77802.txt respectively.

  The Maxim MAX77802 is a Power Management IC (PMIC) that contains 10 high
  efficiency Buck regulators, 32 Low-DropOut (LDO) regulators used to power
  up application processors and peripherals, a 2-channel 32kHz clock outputs,
  a Real-Time-Clock (RTC) and a I2C interface to program the individual

  Bindings for the built-in 32k clock generator block and
  regulators are defined in ../clk/maxim,max77802.txt and
  ../regulator/max77802.txt respectively.

  Required properties:
  - compatible		: Must be "maxim,max77802"
  - reg			: Specifies the I2C slave address of PMIC block.
  - interrupts		: I2C device IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
  - interrupt-parent	: The parent interrupt controller.
