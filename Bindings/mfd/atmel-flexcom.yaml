  The Atmel Flexcom is just a wrapper which embeds a SPI controller, an I2C

  at boot time according to the device tree.

  * Device tree bindings for Atmel Flexcom (Flexible Serial Communication Unit)

  The Atmel Flexcom is just a wrapper which embeds a SPI controller, an I2C
  controller and an USART. Only one function can be used at a time and is chosen
  at boot time according to the device tree.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Should be "atmel,sama5d2-flexcom"
  - reg:			Should be the offset/length value for Flexcom dedicated
  			I/O registers (without USART, TWI or SPI registers).
  - clocks:		Should be the Flexcom peripheral clock from PMC.
  - #address-cells:	Should be <1>
  - #size-cells:		Should be <1>
  - ranges:		Should be one range for the full I/O register region
  			(including USART, TWI and SPI registers).
  - atmel,flexcom-mode:	Should be one of the following values:
  			- <1> for USART
  			- <2> for SPI
  			- <3> for I2C

  Required child:
  A single available child device of type matching the "atmel,flexcom-mode"
  property.

  The phandle provided by the clocks property of the child is the same as one for
  the Flexcom parent.

  For other properties, please refer to the documentations of the respective
  device:
  - ../serial/atmel-usart.txt
  - ../spi/spi_atmel.txt
  - ../i2c/i2c-at91.txt
