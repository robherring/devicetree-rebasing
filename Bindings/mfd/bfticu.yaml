  The bfticu is a multifunction device that manages the whole chassis.
  Its main functionality is to collect IRQs from the whole chassis and signals
  them to a single controller.

  KEYMILE bfticu Chassis Management FPGA

  The bfticu is a multifunction device that manages the whole chassis.
  Its main functionality is to collect IRQs from the whole chassis and signals
  them to a single controller.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "keymile,bfticu"
  - interrupt-controller: the bfticu FPGA is an interrupt controller
  - interrupts: the main IRQ line to signal the collected IRQs
  - #interrupt-cells : is 2 and their usage is compliant to the 2 cells variant
    of Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
  - interrupt-parent: the parent IRQ ctrl the main IRQ is connected to
  - reg: access on the parent local bus (chip select, offset in chip select, size)
