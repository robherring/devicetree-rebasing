  The TWL6040s are 8-channel high quality low-power audio codecs providing audio,
  vibra and GPO functionality on OMAP4+ platforms.
  They are connected ot the host processor via i2c for commands, McPDM for audio
  data and commands.

  Texas Instruments TWL6040 family

  The TWL6040s are 8-channel high quality low-power audio codecs providing audio,
  vibra and GPO functionality on OMAP4+ platforms.
  They are connected ot the host processor via i2c for commands, McPDM for audio
  data and commands.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : "ti,twl6040" for twl6040, "ti,twl6041" for twl6041
  - reg: must be 0x4b for i2c address
  - interrupts: twl6040 has one interrupt line connecteded to the main SoC
  - interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller
  - gpio-controller:
  - #gpio-cells = <1>: twl6040 provides GPO lines.
  - #clock-cells = <0>; twl6040 is a provider of pdmclk which is used by McPDM
  - twl6040,audpwron-gpio: Power on GPIO line for the twl6040

  - vio-supply: Regulator for the twl6040 VIO supply
  - v2v1-supply: Regulator for the twl6040 V2V1 supply

  Optional properties, nodes:
  - enable-active-high: To power on the twl6040 during boot.
  - clocks: phandle to the clk32k and/or to mclk clock provider
  - clock-names: Must be "clk32k" for the 32K clock and "mclk" for the MCLK.

  Vibra functionality
  Required properties:
  - vddvibl-supply: Regulator for the left vibra motor
  - vddvibr-supply: Regulator for the right vibra motor
  - vibra { }: Configuration section for vibra parameters containing the following
  	     properties:
  - ti,vibldrv-res: Resistance parameter for left driver
  - ti,vibrdrv-res: Resistance parameter for right driver
  - ti,viblmotor-res: Resistance parameter for left motor
  - ti,viblmotor-res: Resistance parameter for right motor

  Optional properties within vibra { } section:
  - vddvibl_uV: If the vddvibl default voltage need to be changed
  - vddvibr_uV: If the vddvibr default voltage need to be changed
