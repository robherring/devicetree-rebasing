  * ST Microelectronics STMPE Multi-Functional Device

  STMPE is an MFD device which may expose the following inbuilt devices: gpio,
  keypad, touchscreen, adc, pwm, rotator.

  Required properties:
   - compatible                   : "st,stmpe[610|801|811|1600|1601|2401|2403]"
   - reg                          : I2C/SPI address of the device

  Optional properties:
   - interrupts                   : The interrupt outputs from the controller
   - interrupt-controller         : Marks the device node as an interrupt controller
   - interrupt-parent             : Specifies which IRQ controller we're connected to
   - wakeup-source                : Marks the input device as wakable
   - st,autosleep-timeout         : Valid entries (ms); 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024
   - irq-gpio                     : If present, which GPIO to use for event IRQ
