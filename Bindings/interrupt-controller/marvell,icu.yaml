  Marvell ICU Interrupt Controller
  --------------------------------

  The Marvell ICU (Interrupt Consolidation Unit) controller is
  responsible for collecting all wired-interrupt sources in the CP and
  communicating them to the GIC in the AP, the unit translates interrupt
  requests on input wires to MSG memory mapped transactions to the GIC.

  Required properties:

  - compatible: Should be "marvell,cp110-icu"

  - reg: Should contain ICU registers location and length.

  - #interrupt-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
    interrupt source. The value shall be 3.

    The 1st cell is the group type of the ICU interrupt. Possible group
    types are:

     ICU_GRP_NSR (0x0) : Shared peripheral interrupt, non-secure
     ICU_GRP_SR  (0x1) : Shared peripheral interrupt, secure
     ICU_GRP_SEI (0x4) : System error interrupt
     ICU_GRP_REI (0x5) : RAM error interrupt

    The 2nd cell is the index of the interrupt in the ICU unit.

    The 3rd cell is the type of the interrupt. See arm,gic.txt for
    details.

  - interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt
    controller.

  - msi-parent: Should point to the GICP controller, the GIC extension
    that allows to trigger interrupts using MSG memory mapped
    transactions.
