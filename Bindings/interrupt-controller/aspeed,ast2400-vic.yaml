  Aspeed Vectored Interrupt Controller

  These bindings are for the Aspeed interrupt controller. The AST2400 and
  AST2500 SoC families include a legacy register layout before a re-designed
  layout, but the bindings do not prescribe the use of one or the other.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : "aspeed,ast2400-vic"
                 "aspeed,ast2500-vic"

  - interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
    interrupt source. The value shall be 1.
