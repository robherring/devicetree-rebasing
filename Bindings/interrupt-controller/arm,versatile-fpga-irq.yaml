  One or more FPGA IRQ controllers can be synthesized in an ARM reference board
  such as the Integrator or Versatile family. The output of these different
  controllers are OR:ed together and fed to the CPU tile's IRQ input. Each
  instance can handle up to 32 interrupts.

  * ARM Versatile FPGA interrupt controller

  One or more FPGA IRQ controllers can be synthesized in an ARM reference board
  such as the Integrator or Versatile family. The output of these different
  controllers are OR:ed together and fed to the CPU tile's IRQ input. Each
  instance can handle up to 32 interrupts.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "arm,versatile-fpga-irq" or "oxsemi,ox810se-rps-irq"
  - interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells: The number of cells to define the interrupts.  Must be 1
    as the FPGA IRQ controller has no configuration options for interrupt
    sources.  The cell is a u32 and defines the interrupt number.
  - reg: The register bank for the FPGA interrupt controller.
  - clear-mask: a u32 number representing the mask written to clear all IRQs
    on the controller at boot for example.
  - valid-mask: a u32 number representing a bit mask determining which of
    the interrupts are valid. Unconnected/unused lines are set to 0, and
    the system till not make it possible for devices to request these
    interrupts.
