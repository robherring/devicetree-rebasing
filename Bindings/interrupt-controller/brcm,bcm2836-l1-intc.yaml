title: BCM2836 per-CPU interrupt controller

maintainers:

description: |+
  The BCM2836 has a per-cpu interrupt controller for the timer, PMU
  events, and SMP IPIs.  One of the CPUs may receive interrupts for the
  peripheral (GPU) events, which chain to the BCM2835-style interrupt
  controller.

  BCM2836 per-CPU interrupt controller

  The BCM2836 has a per-cpu interrupt controller for the timer, PMU
  events, and SMP IPIs.  One of the CPUs may receive interrupts for the
  peripheral (GPU) events, which chain to the BCM2835-style interrupt
  controller.

  Required properties:

  - compatible:	 	Should be "brcm,bcm2836-l1-intc"
  - reg:			Specifies base physical address and size of the
  			  registers
  - interrupt-controller:	Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells:	Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  			  interrupt source. The value shall be 2

  Please refer to interrupts.txt in this directory for details of the common
  Interrupt Controllers bindings used by client devices.

  The interrupt sources are as follows:

  0: CNTPSIRQ
  1: CNTPNSIRQ
  2: CNTHPIRQ
  3: CNTVIRQ
  8: GPU_FAST
  9: PMU_FAST
