title: Broadcom BCM7038-style Level 1 interrupt controller

description: |+
  This block is a first level interrupt controller that is typically connected
  directly to one of the HW INT lines on each CPU.  Every BCM7xxx set-top chip
  since BCM7038 has contained this hardware.

  Key elements of the hardware design include:

  - 64, 96, 128, or 160 incoming level IRQ lines

  - Most onchip peripherals are wired directly to an L1 input

  - A separate instance of the register set for each CPU, allowing individual
    peripheral IRQs to be routed to any CPU

  - Atomic mask/unmask operations

  - No polarity/level/edge settings

  - No FIFO or priority encoder logic; software is expected to read all
    2-5 status words to determine which IRQs are pending

  Broadcom BCM7038-style Level 1 interrupt controller

  This block is a first level interrupt controller that is typically connected
  directly to one of the HW INT lines on each CPU.  Every BCM7xxx set-top chip
  since BCM7038 has contained this hardware.

  Key elements of the hardware design include:

  - 64, 96, 128, or 160 incoming level IRQ lines

  - Most onchip peripherals are wired directly to an L1 input

  - A separate instance of the register set for each CPU, allowing individual
    peripheral IRQs to be routed to any CPU

  - Atomic mask/unmask operations

  - No polarity/level/edge settings

  - No FIFO or priority encoder logic; software is expected to read all
    2-5 status words to determine which IRQs are pending

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "brcm,bcm7038-l1-intc"
  - reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers;
    the number of supported IRQs is inferred from the size argument
  - interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
    source, should be 1.
  - interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller(s)
    this one is cascaded from
  - interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent controller
    node; valid values depend on the type of parent interrupt controller

  If multiple reg ranges and interrupt-parent entries are present on an SMP
  system, the driver will allow IRQ SMP affinity to be set up through the
  /proc/irq/ interface.  In the simplest possible configuration, only one
  reg range and one interrupt-parent is needed.
