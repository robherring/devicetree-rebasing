  * TI Common Platform Interrupt Controller

  Common Platform Interrupt Controller (cp_intc) is used on
  OMAP-L1x SoCs and can support several configurable number
  of interrupts.

  Main node required properties:

  - compatible : should be:
  	"ti,cp-intc"
  - interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
    interrupt source. The type shall be a <u32> and the value shall be 1.

    The cell contains the interrupt number in the range [0-128].
  - ti,intc-size: Number of interrupts handled by the interrupt controller.
  - reg: physical base address and size of the intc registers map.
