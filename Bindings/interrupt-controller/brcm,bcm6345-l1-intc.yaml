title: Broadcom BCM6345-style Level 1 interrupt controller

maintainers:
  - Simon Arlott <simon@fire.lp0.eu>
description: |+
  This block is a first level interrupt controller that is typically connected
  directly to one of the HW INT lines on each CPU.

  Key elements of the hardware design include:

  - 32, 64 or 128 incoming level IRQ lines

  - Most onchip peripherals are wired directly to an L1 input

  - A separate instance of the register set for each CPU, allowing individual
    peripheral IRQs to be routed to any CPU

  - Contains one or more enable/status word pairs per CPU

  - No atomic set/clear operations

  - No polarity/level/edge settings

  - No FIFO or priority encoder logic; software is expected to read all
    2-4 status words to determine which IRQs are pending

  Broadcom BCM6345-style Level 1 interrupt controller

  This block is a first level interrupt controller that is typically connected
  directly to one of the HW INT lines on each CPU.

  Key elements of the hardware design include:

  - 32, 64 or 128 incoming level IRQ lines

  - Most onchip peripherals are wired directly to an L1 input

  - A separate instance of the register set for each CPU, allowing individual

  - No atomic set/clear operations

  - No polarity/level/edge settings

  - No FIFO or priority encoder logic; software is expected to read all
    2-4 status words to determine which IRQs are pending

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "brcm,bcm<soc>-l1-intc", "brcm,bcm6345-l1-intc"
  - reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers;
    the number of supported IRQs is inferred from the size argument
  - interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
    source, should be 1.
  - interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller(s)
    this one is cascaded from
  - interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent controller
    node; valid values depend on the type of parent interrupt controller

  If multiple reg ranges and interrupt-parent entries are present on an SMP
  system, the driver will allow IRQ SMP affinity to be set up through the
  /proc/irq/ interface.  In the simplest possible configuration, only one
  reg range and one interrupt-parent is needed.

  The driver operates in native CPU endian by default, there is no support for
  specifying an alternative endianness.
