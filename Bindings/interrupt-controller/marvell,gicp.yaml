  -----------------------

  GICP is a Marvell extension of the GIC that allows to trigger GIC SPI
  interrupts by doing a memory transaction. It is used by the ICU
  located in the Marvell CP110 to turn wired interrupts inside the CP
  into GIC SPI interrupts.

  Required properties:

  - compatible: Must be "marvell,ap806-gicp"

  - reg: Must be the address and size of the GICP SPI registers

  - marvell,spi-ranges: tuples of GIC SPI interrupts ranges available
    for this GICP

  - msi-controller: indicates that this is an MSI controller
