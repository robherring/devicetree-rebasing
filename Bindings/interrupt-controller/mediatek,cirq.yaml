description: |+
  In Mediatek SOCs, the CIRQ is a low power interrupt controller designed to
  work outside MCUSYS which comprises with Cortex-Ax cores,CCI and GIC.
  The external interrupts (outside MCUSYS) will feed through CIRQ and connect
  to GIC in MCUSYS. When CIRQ is enabled, it will record the edge-sensitive
  interrupts and generate a pulse signal to parent interrupt controller when
  flush command is executed. With CIRQ, MCUSYS can be completely turned off
  to improve the system power consumption without losing interrupts.

  * Mediatek 27xx cirq

  In Mediatek SOCs, the CIRQ is a low power interrupt controller designed to
  work outside MCUSYS which comprises with Cortex-Ax cores,CCI and GIC.
  The external interrupts (outside MCUSYS) will feed through CIRQ and connect
  to GIC in MCUSYS. When CIRQ is enabled, it will record the edge-sensitive
  interrupts and generate a pulse signal to parent interrupt controller when
  flush command is executed. With CIRQ, MCUSYS can be completely turned off
  to improve the system power consumption without losing interrupts.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be one of
    - "mediatek,mt2701-cirq" for mt2701 CIRQ
    - "mediatek,mt8135-cirq" for mt8135 CIRQ
    - "mediatek,mt8173-cirq" for mt8173 CIRQ
    and "mediatek,cirq" as a fallback.
  - interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
  - #interrupt-cells : Use the same format as specified by GIC in arm,gic.txt.
  - interrupt-parent: phandle of irq parent for cirq. The parent must
    use the same interrupt-cells format as GIC.
  - reg: Physical base address of the cirq registers and length of memory
    mapped region.
  - mediatek,ext-irq-range: Identifies external irq number range in different
    SOCs.
