  * ARM Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC)

  The NVIC provides an interrupt controller that is tightly coupled to
  Cortex-M based processor cores.  The NVIC implemented on different SoCs
  vary in the number of interrupts and priority bits per interrupt.

  Main node required properties:

  - compatible : should be one of:
  	"arm,v6m-nvic"
  	"arm,v7m-nvic"
  	"arm,v8m-nvic"
  - interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
    interrupt source.  The type shall be a <u32> and the value shall be 2.

    The 1st cell contains the interrupt number for the interrupt type.

    The 2nd cell is the priority of the interrupt.

  - reg : Specifies base physical address(s) and size of the NVIC registers.
    This is at a fixed address (0xe000e100) and size (0xc00).

  - arm,num-irq-priority-bits: The number of priority bits implemented by the
    given SoC
