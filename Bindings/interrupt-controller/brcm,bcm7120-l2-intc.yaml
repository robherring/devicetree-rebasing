description: |+
  This interrupt controller hardware is a second level interrupt controller that
  is hooked to a parent interrupt controller: e.g: ARM GIC for ARM-based
  platforms. It can be found on BCM7xxx products starting with BCM7120.

  Such an interrupt controller has the following hardware design:

  - outputs multiple interrupts signals towards its interrupt controller parent

  - controls how some of the interrupts will be flowing, whether they will
    directly output an interrupt signal towards the interrupt controller parent,
    or if they will output an interrupt signal at this 2nd level interrupt
    controller, in particular for UARTs

  - has one 32-bit enable word and one 32-bit status word

  - no atomic set/clear operations

  - not all bits within the interrupt controller actually map to an interrupt

  The typical hardware layout for this controller is represented below:

  2nd level interrupt line		Outputs for the parent controller (e.g: ARM GIC)

  0 -----[ MUX ] ------------|==========> GIC interrupt 75
            \-----------\

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "brcm,bcm7120-l2-intc"
  - reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers
  - interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
    source, should be 1.
  - interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller
    this one is cascaded from
  - interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent controller
    node, valid values depend on the type of parent interrupt controller
  - brcm,int-map-mask: 32-bits bit mask describing how many and which interrupts
    are wired to this 2nd level interrupt controller, and how they match their
    respective interrupt parents. Should match exactly the number of interrupts
    specified in the 'interrupts' property.

  Optional properties:

  - brcm,irq-can-wake: if present, this means the L2 controller can be used as a
    wakeup source for system suspend/resume.

  - brcm,int-fwd-mask: if present, a bit mask to configure the interrupts which
    have a mux gate, typically UARTs. Setting these bits will make their
    respective interrupt outputs bypass this 2nd level interrupt controller
    completely; it is completely transparent for the interrupt controller
    parent. This should have one 32-bit word per enable/status pair.
