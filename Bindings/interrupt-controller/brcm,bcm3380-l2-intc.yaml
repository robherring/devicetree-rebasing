  Broadcom BCM3380-style Level 1 / Level 2 interrupt controller

  This interrupt controller shows up in various forms on many BCM338x/BCM63xx
  chipsets.  It has the following properties:

  - outputs a single interrupt signal to its interrupt controller parent

  - contains one or more enable/status word pairs, which often appear at
    different offsets in different blocks

  - no atomic set/clear operations

  Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "brcm,bcm3380-l2-intc"
  - reg: specifies one or more enable/status pairs, in the following format:
    <enable_reg 0x4 status_reg 0x4>...
  - interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
    source, should be 1.
  - interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller
    this one is cascaded from
  - interrupts: specifies the interrupt line in the interrupt-parent controller
    node, valid values depend on the type of parent interrupt controller

  Optional properties:

  - brcm,irq-can-wake: if present, this means the L2 controller can be used as a
    wakeup source for system suspend/resume.
