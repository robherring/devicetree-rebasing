  All Tegra SoCs contain a legacy interrupt controller that routes
  interrupts to the GIC, and also serves as a wakeup source. It is also
  referred to as "ictlr", hence the name of the binding.

  The HW block exposes a number of interrupt controllers, each
  implementing a set of 32 interrupts.

  NVIDIA Legacy Interrupt Controller

  All Tegra SoCs contain a legacy interrupt controller that routes
  interrupts to the GIC, and also serves as a wakeup source. It is also
  referred to as "ictlr", hence the name of the binding.

  The HW block exposes a number of interrupt controllers, each
  implementing a set of 32 interrupts.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be: "nvidia,tegra<chip>-ictlr". The LIC on
    subsequent SoCs remained backwards-compatible with Tegra30, so on
    Tegra generations later than Tegra30 the compatible value should
    include "nvidia,tegra30-ictlr".	
  - reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
    Each controller must be described separately (Tegra20 has 4 of them,
    whereas Tegra30 and later have 5"  
  - interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
  - #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
    interrupt source. The value must be 3.
  - interrupt-parent : a phandle to the GIC these interrupts are routed
    to.

  Notes:

  - Because this HW ultimately routes interrupts to the GIC, the
    interrupt specifier must be that of the GIC.
  - Only SPIs can use the ictlr as an interrupt parent. SGIs and PPIs
    are explicitly forbidden.
