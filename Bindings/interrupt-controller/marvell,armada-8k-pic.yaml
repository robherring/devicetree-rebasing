  Marvell Armada 7K/8K PIC Interrupt controller
  ---------------------------------------------

  This is the Device Tree binding for the PIC, a secondary interrupt
  controller available on the Marvell Armada 7K/8K ARM64 SoCs, and
  typically connected to the GIC as the primary interrupt controller.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "marvell,armada-8k-pic"
  - interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
  - #interrupt-cells: the number of cells to define interrupts on this
    controller. Should be 1
  - reg: the register area for the PIC interrupt controller
  - interrupts: the interrupt to the primary interrupt controller,
    typically the GIC
