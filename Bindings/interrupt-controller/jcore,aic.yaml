  J-Core Advanced Interrupt Controller

  Required properties:

  - compatible: Should be "jcore,aic1" for the (obsolete) first-generation aic
    with 8 interrupt lines with programmable priorities, or "jcore,aic2" for
    the "aic2" core with 64 interrupts.

  - reg: Memory region(s) for configuration. For SMP, there should be one
    region per cpu, indexed by the sequential, zero-based hardware cpu
    number.

  - interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller

  - #interrupt-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
    interrupt source. The value shall be 1.
