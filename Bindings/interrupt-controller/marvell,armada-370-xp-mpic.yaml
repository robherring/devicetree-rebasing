  Marvell Armada 370, 375, 38x, XP Interrupt Controller
  -----------------------------------------------------

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "marvell,mpic"
  - interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
  - msi-controller: Identifies the node as an PCI Message Signaled
    Interrupt controller.
  - #interrupt-cells: The number of cells to define the interrupts. Should be 1.
    The cell is the IRQ number

  - reg: Should contain PMIC registers location and length. First pair
    for the main interrupt registers, second pair for the per-CPU
    interrupt registers. For this last pair, to be compliant with SMP
    support, the "virtual" must be use (For the record, these registers
    automatically map to the interrupt controller registers of the
    current CPU)

  Optional properties:

  - interrupts: If defined, then it indicates that this MPIC is
    connected as a slave to another interrupt controller. This is
    typically the case on Armada 375 and Armada 38x, where the MPIC is
    connected as a slave to the Cortex-A9 GIC. The provided interrupt
    indicate to which GIC interrupt the MPIC output is connected.
