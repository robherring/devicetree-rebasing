  ST-Ericsson COH 901 318 DMA Controller

  This is a DMA controller which has begun as a fork of the
  ARM PL08x PrimeCell VHDL code.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "stericsson,coh901318"
  - reg: register locations and length
  - interrupts: the single DMA IRQ
  - #dma-cells: must be set to <1>, as the channels on the
    COH 901 318 are simple and identified by a single number
  - dma-channels: the number of DMA channels handled
