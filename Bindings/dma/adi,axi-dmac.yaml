  Analog Device AXI-DMAC DMA controller

  Required properties:
   - compatible: Must be "adi,axi-dmac-1.00.a".
   - reg: Specification for the controllers memory mapped register map.
   - interrupts: Specification for the controllers interrupt.
   - clocks: Phandle and specifier to the controllers AXI interface clock
   - #dma-cells: Must be 1.

  Required sub-nodes:
   - adi,channels: This sub-node must contain a sub-node for each DMA channel. For
     the channel sub-nodes the following bindings apply. They must match the
     configuration options of the peripheral as it was instantiated.

  Required properties for adi,channels sub-node:
   - #size-cells: Must be 0
   - #address-cells: Must be 1

  Required channel sub-node properties:
   - reg: Which channel this node refers to.
   - adi,length-width: Width of the DMA transfer length register.
   - adi,source-bus-width,
     adi,destination-bus-width: Width of the source or destination bus in bits.
   - adi,source-bus-type,
     adi,destination-bus-type: Type of the source or destination bus. Must be one
     of the following:
  	0 (AXI_DMAC_TYPE_AXI_MM): Memory mapped AXI interface
  	1 (AXI_DMAC_TYPE_AXI_STREAM): Streaming AXI interface
  	2 (AXI_DMAC_TYPE_AXI_FIFO): FIFO interface

  Optional channel properties:
   - adi,cyclic: Must be set if the channel supports hardware cyclic DMA
     transfers.
   - adi,2d: Must be set if the channel supports hardware 2D DMA transfers.

  DMA clients connected to the AXI-DMAC DMA controller must use the format
  described in the dma.txt file using a one-cell specifier. The value of the
  specifier refers to the DMA channel index.
