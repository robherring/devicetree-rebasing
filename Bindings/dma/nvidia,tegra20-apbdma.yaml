  * NVIDIA Tegra APB DMA controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "nvidia,<chip>-apbdma"
  - reg: Should contain DMA registers location and length. This shuld include
    all of the per-channel registers.
  - interrupts: Should contain all of the per-channel DMA interrupts.
  - clocks: Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names : Must include the following entries:
    - dma
  - #dma-cells : Must be <1>. This dictates the length of DMA specifiers in
    client nodes' dmas properties. The specifier represents the DMA request
    select value for the peripheral. For more details, consult the Tegra TRM's
    documentation of the APB DMA channel control register REQ_SEL field.
