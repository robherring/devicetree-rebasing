title: BCM2835 DMA controller

maintainers:

description: |+
  The BCM2835 DMA controller has 16 channels in total.
  Only the lower 13 channels have an associated IRQ.
  Some arbitrary channels are used by the firmware
  (1,3,6,7 in the current firmware version).
  The channels 0,2 and 3 have special functionality
  and should not be used by the driver.

  * BCM2835 DMA controller

  The BCM2835 DMA controller has 16 channels in total.
  Only the lower 13 channels have an associated IRQ.
  Some arbitrary channels are used by the firmware
  (1,3,6,7 in the current firmware version).
  The channels 0,2 and 3 have special functionality
  and should not be used by the driver.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "brcm,bcm2835-dma".
  - reg: Should contain DMA registers location and length.
  - interrupts: Should contain the DMA interrupts associated
  		to the DMA channels in ascending order.
  - interrupt-names: Should contain the names of the interrupt
  		   in the form "dmaXX".
  		   Use "dma-shared-all" for the common interrupt line
  		   that is shared by all dma channels.
  - #dma-cells: Must be <1>, the cell in the dmas property of the
  		client device represents the DREQ number.
  - brcm,dma-channel-mask: Bit mask representing the channels
  			 not used by the firmware in ascending order,
  			 i.e. first channel corresponds to LSB.
