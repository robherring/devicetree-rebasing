    uart-bam: dma@f9984000 = {
      compatible = "qcom,bam-v1.4.0";
      reg = <0xf9984000 0x15000>;

    };

    DMA clients must use the format described in the dma.txt file, using a two cell
    specifier for each channel.

    Example:
    serial@f991e000 {
      compatible = "qcom,msm-uart";
      reg = <0xf991e000 0x1000>
        <0xf9944000 0x19000>;
      interrupts = <0 108 0>;
      clocks = <&gcc GCC_BLSP1_UART2_APPS_CLK>,
        <&gcc GCC_BLSP1_AHB_CLK>;
      clock-names = "core", "iface";

      dmas = <&uart-bam 0>, <&uart-bam 1>;
      dma-names = "rx", "tx";
    };

  QCOM BAM DMA controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must be one of the following:
   * "qcom,bam-v1.4.0" for MSM8974, APQ8074 and APQ8084
   * "qcom,bam-v1.3.0" for APQ8064, IPQ8064 and MSM8960
   * "qcom,bam-v1.7.0" for MSM8916
  - reg: Address range for DMA registers
  - interrupts: Should contain the one interrupt shared by all channels
  - #dma-cells: must be <1>, the cell in the dmas property of the client device
    represents the channel number
  - clocks: required clock
  - clock-names: must contain "bam_clk" entry
  - qcom,ee : indicates the active Execution Environment identifier (0-7) used in
    the secure world.
  - qcom,controlled-remotely : optional, indicates that the bam is controlled by
    remote proccessor i.e. execution environment.
