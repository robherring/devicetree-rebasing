  * ARM PrimeCell PL330 DMA Controller

  The ARM PrimeCell PL330 DMA controller can move blocks of memory contents
  between memory and peripherals or memory to memory.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: should include both "arm,pl330" and "arm,primecell".
    - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
      region.
    - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.

  Optional properties:
    - dma-coherent      : Present if dma operations are coherent
    - #dma-cells: must be <1>. used to represent the number of integer
      cells in the dmas property of client device.
    - dma-channels: contains the total number of DMA channels supported by the DMAC
    - dma-requests: contains the total number of DMA requests supported by the DMAC
    - arm,pl330-broken-no-flushp: quirk for avoiding to execute DMAFLUSHP
