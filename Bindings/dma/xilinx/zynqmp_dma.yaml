  Xilinx ZynqMP DMA engine, it does support memory to memory transfers,
  memory to device and device to memory transfers. It also has flow
  control and rate control support for slave/peripheral dma access.

  Required properties:
  - compatible		: Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-dma-1.0"
  - reg			: Memory map for gdma/adma module access.
  - interrupt-parent	: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
  - interrupts		: Should contain DMA channel interrupt.
  - xlnx,bus-width	: Axi buswidth in bits. Should contain 128 or 64
  - clock-names		: List of input clocks "clk_main", "clk_apb"
  			  (see clock bindings for details)

  Optional properties:
  - dma-coherent		: Present if dma operations are coherent.
