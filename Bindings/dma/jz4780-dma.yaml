  * Ingenic JZ4780 DMA Controller

  Required properties:

  - compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4780-dma"
  - reg: Should contain the DMA controller registers location and length.
  - interrupts: Should contain the interrupt specifier of the DMA controller.
  - interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle of the interrupt controller that
  - clocks: Should contain a clock specifier for the JZ4780 PDMA clock.
  - #dma-cells: Must be <2>. Number of integer cells in the dmas property of
    DMA clients (see below).

  Optional properties:

  - ingenic,reserved-channels: Bitmask of channels to reserve for devices that
    need a specific channel. These channels will only be assigned when explicitly
    requested by a client. The primary use for this is channels 0 and 1, which
    can be configured to have special behaviour for NAND/BCH when using
    programmable firmware.
