  * NVIDIA Tegra Audio DMA (ADMA) controller

  The Tegra Audio DMA controller that is used for transferring data
  between system memory and the Audio Processing Engine (APE).

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Must be "nvidia,tegra210-adma".
  - reg: Should contain DMA registers location and length. This should be
    a single entry that includes all of the per-channel registers in one
    contiguous bank.
  - interrupt-parent: Phandle to the interrupt parent controller.
  - interrupts: Should contain all of the per-channel DMA interrupts in
    ascending order with respect to the DMA channel index.
  - clocks: Must contain one entry for the ADMA module clock
    (TEGRA210_CLK_D_AUDIO).
  - clock-names: Must contain the name "d_audio" for the corresponding
    'clocks' entry.
  - #dma-cells : Must be 1. The first cell denotes the receive/transmit
    request number and should be between 1 and the maximum number of
    requests supported. This value corresponds to the RX/TX_REQUEST_SELECT
    fields in the ADMA_CHn_CTRL register.
