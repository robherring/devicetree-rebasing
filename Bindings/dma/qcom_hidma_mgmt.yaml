description: |+
  Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA is a high speed DMA device. It only supports
  memcpy and memset capabilities. It has been designed for virtualized
  environments.

  Each HIDMA HW instance consists of multiple DMA channels. These channels
  share the same bandwidth. The bandwidth utilization can be partitioned
  among channels based on the priority and weight assignments.

  There are only two priority levels and 15 weigh assignments possible.

  Other parameters here determine how much of the system bus this HIDMA
  instance can use like maximum read/write request and number of bytes to
  read/write in a single burst.

  Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA Management interface

  Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA is a high speed DMA device. It only supports
  memcpy and memset capabilities. It has been designed for virtualized
  environments.

  Each HIDMA HW instance consists of multiple DMA channels. These channels
  share the same bandwidth. The bandwidth utilization can be partitioned
  among channels based on the priority and weight assignments.

  There are only two priority levels and 15 weigh assignments possible.

  Other parameters here determine how much of the system bus this HIDMA
  instance can use like maximum read/write request and number of bytes to
  read/write in a single burst.

  Main node required properties:
  - compatible: "qcom,hidma-mgmt-1.0";
  - reg: Address range for DMA device
  - dma-channels: Number of channels supported by this DMA controller.
  - max-write-burst-bytes: Maximum write burst in bytes that HIDMA can
    occupy the bus for in a single transaction. A memcpy requested is
    fragmented to multiples of this amount. This parameter is used while
    writing into destination memory. Setting this value incorrectly can
    starve other peripherals in the system.
  - max-read-burst-bytes: Maximum read burst in bytes that HIDMA can
    occupy the bus for in a single transaction. A memcpy request is
    fragmented to multiples of this amount. This parameter is used while
    reading the source memory. Setting this value incorrectly can starve
    other peripherals in the system.
  - max-write-transactions: This value is how many times a write burst is
    applied back to back while writing to the destination before yielding
    the bus.
  - max-read-transactions: This value is how many times a read burst is
    applied back to back while reading the source before yielding the bus.
  - channel-reset-timeout-cycles: Channel reset timeout in cycles for this SOC.
    Once a reset is applied to the HW, HW starts a timer for reset operation
    to confirm. If reset is not completed within this time, HW reports reset
    failure.

  Sub-nodes:

  HIDMA has one or more DMA channels that are used to move data from one
  memory location to another.

  When the OS is not in control of the management interface (i.e. it's a guest),
  the channel nodes appear on their own, not under a management node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must contain "qcom,hidma-1.0" for initial HW or
    "qcom,hidma-1.1"/"qcom,hidma-1.2" for MSI capable HW.
  - reg: Addresses for the transfer and event channel
  - interrupts: Should contain the event interrupt
  - desc-count: Number of asynchronous requests this channel can handle
  - iommus: required a iommu node

  Optional properties for MSI:
  - msi-parent : See the generic MSI binding described in
   devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/msi.txt for a description of the
   msi-parent property.
