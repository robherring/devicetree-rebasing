  QCOM GSBI (General Serial Bus Interface) Driver

  The GSBI controller is modeled as a node with zero or more child nodes, each
  representing a serial sub-node device that is mux'd as part of the GSBI
  configuration settings.  The mode setting will govern the input/output mode of
  the 4 GSBI IOs.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:	Should contain "qcom,gsbi-v1.0.0"
  - cell-index:	Should contain the GSBI index
  - reg: Address range for GSBI registers
  - clocks: required clock
  - clock-names: must contain "iface" entry
  - qcom,mode : indicates MUX value for configuration of the serial interface.
    Please reference dt-bindings/soc/qcom,gsbi.h for valid mux values.

  Optional properties:
  - qcom,crci : indicates CRCI MUX value for QUP CRCI ports.  Please reference
    dt-bindings/soc/qcom,gsbi.h for valid CRCI mux values.
  - syscon-tcsr: indicates phandle of TCSR syscon node.  Required if child uses
    dma.

  Required properties if child node exists:
  - #address-cells: Must be 1
  - #size-cells: Must be 1
  - ranges: Must be present

  Properties for children:

  A GSBI controller node can contain 0 or more child nodes representing serial
  devices.  These serial devices can be a QCOM UART, I2C controller, spi
  controller, or some combination of aforementioned devices.

  See the following for child node definitions:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/qcom,i2c-qup.txt
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/qcom,spi-qup.txt
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/qcom,msm-uartdm.txt
