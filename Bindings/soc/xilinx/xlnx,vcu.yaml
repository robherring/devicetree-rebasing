  General concept
  ---------------

  LogicoreIP design to provide the isolation between processing system
  and programmable logic. Also provides the list of register set to configure
  the frequency.

  General concept
  ---------------

  LogicoreIP design to provide the isolation between processing system
  and programmable logic. Also provides the list of register set to configure
  the frequency.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: shall be one of:
  	"xlnx,vcu"
  	"xlnx,vcu-logicoreip-1.0"
  - reg, reg-names: There are two sets of registers need to provide.
  	1. vcu slcr
  	2. Logicore
  	reg-names should contain name for the each register sequence.
  - clocks: phandle for aclk and pll_ref clocksource
  - clock-names: The identification string, "aclk", is always required for
     the axi clock. "pll_ref" is required for pll.
