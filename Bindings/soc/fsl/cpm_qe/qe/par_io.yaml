  This node configures Parallel I/O ports for CPUs with QE support.
  The node should reside in the "soc" node of the tree.  For each
  device that using parallel I/O ports, a child node should be created.
  See the definition of the Pin configuration nodes below for more

  * Parallel I/O Ports

  This node configures Parallel I/O ports for CPUs with QE support.
  The node should reside in the "soc" node of the tree.  For each
  device that using parallel I/O ports, a child node should be created.
  See the definition of the Pin configuration nodes below for more
  information.

  Required properties:
  - device_type : should be "par_io".
  - reg : offset to the register set and its length.
  - num-ports : number of Parallel I/O ports
