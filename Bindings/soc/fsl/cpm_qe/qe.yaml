  NOTE:  This is an interim binding; it should be updated to fit
  in with the CPM binding later in this document.

  Basically, it is a bus of devices, that could act more or less
  as a complete entity (UCC, USB etc ). All of them should be siblings on
  the "root" qe node, using the common properties from there.
  The description below applies to the qe of MPC8360 and
  more nodes and properties would be extended in the future.

  * Freescale QUICC Engine module (QE)
  This represents qe module that is installed on PowerQUICC II Pro.

  NOTE:  This is an interim binding; it should be updated to fit
  in with the CPM binding later in this document.

  Basically, it is a bus of devices, that could act more or less
  as a complete entity (UCC, USB etc ). All of them should be siblings on
  the "root" qe node, using the common properties from there.
  The description below applies to the qe of MPC8360 and
  more nodes and properties would be extended in the future.

  i) Root QE device

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "fsl,qe";
  - model : precise model of the QE, Can be "QE", "CPM", or "CPM2"
  - reg : offset and length of the device registers.
  - bus-frequency : the clock frequency for QUICC Engine.
  - fsl,qe-num-riscs: define how many RISC engines the QE has.
  - fsl,qe-num-snums: define how many serial number(SNUM) the QE can use for the
    threads.

  Optional properties:
  - fsl,firmware-phandle:
      Usage: required only if there is no fsl,qe-firmware child node
      Value type: <phandle>
      Definition: Points to a firmware node (see "QE Firmware Node" below)
          that contains the firmware that should be uploaded for this QE.
          The compatible property for the firmware node should say,
          "fsl,qe-firmware".

  Recommended properties
  - brg-frequency : the internal clock source frequency for baud-rate
    generators in Hz.
