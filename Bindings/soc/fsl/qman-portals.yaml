  	- QMan Portal
  	- Example

  QMan Portal Node

  Portals are memory mapped interfaces to QMan that allow low-latency, lock-less
  interaction by software running on processor cores, accelerators and network
  interfaces with the QMan

  PROPERTIES

  - compatible
  	Usage:		Required
  	Value type:	<stringlist>
  	Definition:	Must include "fsl,qman-portal-<hardware revision>"
  			May include "fsl,<SoC>-qman-portal" or "fsl,qman-portal"

  - reg
  	Usage:		Required
  	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition:	Two regions. The first is the cache-enabled region of
  			the portal. The second is the cache-inhibited region of
  			the portal

  - interrupts
  	Usage:		Required
  	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition:	Standard property

  - fsl,liodn
  	Usage:		See pamu.txt
  	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition:	Two LIODN(s). DQRR LIODN (DLIODN) and Frame LIODN
  			(FLIODN)

  - fsl,iommu-parent
  	Usage:		See pamu.txt
  	Value type:	<phandle>
  	Definition:	PAMU property used for dynamic LIODN assignment

  	For additional details about the PAMU/LIODN binding(s) see pamu.txt

  - cell-index
  	Usage:		Required
  	Value type:	<u32>
  	Definition:	The hardware index of the channel. This can also be
  			determined by dividing any of the channel's 8 work queue
  			IDs by 8

  In addition to these properties the qman-portals should have sub-nodes to
  represent the HW devices/portals that are connected to the software portal
  described here

  The currently supported sub-nodes are:
  	* fman0
  	* fman1
  	* pme
  	* crypto
