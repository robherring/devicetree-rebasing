description: |+
  The QMSS (Queue Manager Sub System) found on Keystone SOCs is one of
  the main hardware sub system which forms the backbone of the Keystone
  multi-core Navigator. QMSS consist of queue managers, packed-data structure
  processors(PDSP), linking RAM, descriptor pools and infrastructure
  Packet DMA.
  The Queue Manager is a hardware module that is responsible for accelerating
  management of the packet queues. Packets are queued/de-queued by writing or
  reading descriptor address to a particular memory mapped location. The PDSPs
  perform QMSS related functions like accumulation, QoS, or event management.
  Linking RAM registers are used to link the descriptors which are stored in
  descriptor RAM. Descriptor RAM is configurable as internal or external memory.
  The QMSS driver manages the PDSP setups, linking RAM regions,
  queue pool management (allocation, push, pop and notify) and descriptor
  pool management.

  Required properties:
  - compatible	: Must be "ti,keystone-navigator-qmss";
  - clocks	: phandle to the reference clock for this device.
  - queue-range	: <start number> total range of queue numbers for the device.
  - linkram0	: <address size> for internal link ram, where size is the total
  		  link ram entries.
  - linkram1	: <address size> for external link ram, where size is the total
  		  external link ram entries. If the address is specified as "0"
  		  driver will allocate memory.
  - qmgrs         : child node describing the individual queue managers on the
  		  SoC. On keystone 1 devices there should be only one node.
  		  On keystone 2 devices there can be more than 1 node.
    -- managed-queues	: the actual queues managed by each queue manager
  			  instance, specified as <"base queue #" "# of queues">.
    -- reg		: Address and size of the register set for the device.
  			  Register regions should be specified in the following
  			  order
  			  - Queue Peek region.
  			  - Queue status RAM.
  			  - Queue configuration region.
  			  - Descriptor memory setup region.
  			  - Queue Management/Queue Proxy region for queue Push.
  			  - Queue Management/Queue Proxy region for queue Pop.
  - queue-pools	: child node classifying the queue ranges into pools.
  		  Queue ranges are grouped into 3 type of pools:
  		  - qpend	    : pool of qpend(interruptible) queues
  		  - general-purpose : pool of general queues, primarily used
  				      as free descriptor queues or the
  				      transmit DMA queues.
  		  - accumulator	    : pool of queues on PDSP accumulator channel
  		  Each range can have the following properties:
    -- qrange		: number of queues to use per queue range, specified as
  			  <"base queue #" "# of queues">.
    -- interrupts		: Optional property to specify the interrupt mapping
  			  for interruptible queues. The driver additionally sets
  			  the interrupt affinity hint based on the cpu mask.
    -- qalloc-by-id	: Optional property to specify that the queues in this
  			  range can only be allocated by queue id.
    -- accumulator	: Accumulator channel specification. Any of the PDSPs in
  			  QMSS can be loaded with the accumulator firmware. The
  			  accumulator firmwareâ€™s job is to poll a select number of
  			  queues looking for descriptors that have been pushed
  			  into them. Descriptors are popped from the queue and
  			  placed in a buffer provided by the host. When the list
  			  becomes full or a programmed time period expires, the
  			  accumulator triggers an interrupt to the host to read
  			  the buffer for descriptor information. This firmware
  			  comes in 16, 32, and 48 channel builds. Each of these
  			  channels can be configured to monitor 32 contiguous
  			  queues.  Accumulator channel property is specified as:
  			  <pdsp-id, channel, entries, pacing mode, latency>
  			  pdsp-id     : QMSS PDSP running accumulator firmware
  					on which the channel has to be
  					configured
  			  channel     : Accumulator channel number
  			  entries     : Size of the accumulator descriptor list
  			  pacing mode : Interrupt pacing mode
  					0 : None, i.e interrupt on list full only
  					1 : Time delay since last interrupt
  					2 : Time delay since first new packet
  					3 : Time delay since last new packet
  			  latency     : time to delay the interrupt, specified
  					in microseconds.
    -- multi-queue	: Optional property to specify that the channel has to
  			  monitor up to 32 queues starting at the base queue #.
  - descriptor-regions	: child node describing the memory regions for keystone
  			  navigator packet DMA descriptors. The memory for
  			  descriptors will be allocated by the driver.
    -- id				: region number in QMSS.
    -- region-spec		: specifies the number of descriptors in the
  				  region, specified as
  				  <"# of descriptors" "descriptor size">.
    -- link-index			: start index, i.e. index of the first
  				  descriptor in the region.

  Optional properties:
  - dma-coherent	: Present if DMA operations are coherent.
  - pdsps		: child node describing the PDSP configuration.
    -- firmware		: firmware to be loaded on the PDSP.
    -- id			: the qmss pdsp that will run the firmware.
    -- reg		: Address and size of the register set for the PDSP.
  			  Register regions should be specified in the following
  			  order
  			  - PDSP internal RAM region.
  			  - PDSP control/status region registers.
  			  - QMSS interrupt distributor registers.
  			  - PDSP command interface region.
