properties:
  compatible: {}
examples:
  - |
    bdisp0:bdisp@9f10000 {
      compatible = "st,stih407-bdisp";
      reg = <0x9f10000 0x1000>;

      clock-names = "bdisp";
      clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_IC_BDISP_0>;
    };

    Aliases:
    Each BDISP should have a numbered alias in the aliases node, in the form of
    bdispN, N = 0 or 1.

    Example:

    aliases {
      bdisp0 = &bdisp0;
    };

  bdisp: 2D blitter for STMicroelectronics SoC.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "st,stih407-bdisp".
  - reg: BDISP physical address location and length.
  - interrupts: BDISP interrupt number.
  - clocks: from common clock binding: handle hardware IP needed clocks, the
    number of clocks may depend on the SoC type.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names: names of the clocks listed in clocks property in the same order.
