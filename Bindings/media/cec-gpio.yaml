title: HDMI CEC GPIO driver

description: |+
  The HDMI CEC GPIO module supports CEC implementations where the CEC line
  is hooked up to a pull-up GPIO line and - optionally - the HPD line is
  hooked up to another GPIO line.

  Please note: the maximum voltage for the CEC line is 3.63V, for the HPD
  line it is 5.3V. So you may need some sort of level conversion circuitry
  when connecting them to a GPIO line.

  * HDMI CEC GPIO driver

  The HDMI CEC GPIO module supports CEC implementations where the CEC line
  is hooked up to a pull-up GPIO line and - optionally - the HPD line is
  hooked up to another GPIO line.

  Please note: the maximum voltage for the CEC line is 3.63V, for the HPD
  line it is 5.3V. So you may need some sort of level conversion circuitry
  when connecting them to a GPIO line.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: value must be "cec-gpio".
    - cec-gpios: gpio that the CEC line is connected to. The line should be
      tagged as open drain.

  If the CEC line is associated with an HDMI receiver/transmitter, then the
  following property is also required:

    - hdmi-phandle - phandle to the HDMI controller, see also cec.txt.

  If the CEC line is not associated with an HDMI receiver/transmitter, then
  the following property is optional:

    - hpd-gpios: gpio that the HPD line is connected to.
