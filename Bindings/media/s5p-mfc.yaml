  * Samsung Multi Format Codec (MFC)

  Multi Format Codec (MFC) is the IP present in Samsung SoCs which
  supports high resolution decoding and encoding functionalities.
  The MFC device driver is a v4l2 driver which can encode/decode
  video raw/elementary streams and has support for all popular
  video codecs.

  Required properties:
    - compatible : value should be either one among the following
  	(a) "samsung,mfc-v5" for MFC v5 present in Exynos4 SoCs
  	(b) "samsung,mfc-v6" for MFC v6 present in Exynos5 SoCs
  	(c) "samsung,mfc-v7" for MFC v7 present in Exynos5420 SoC
  	(d) "samsung,mfc-v8" for MFC v8 present in Exynos5800 SoC
  	(e) "samsung,exynos5433-mfc" for MFC v8 present in Exynos5433 SoC

    - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
  	  mapped region.

    - interrupts : MFC interrupt number to the CPU.
    - clocks : from common clock binding: handle to mfc clock.
    - clock-names : from common clock binding: must contain "mfc",
  		  corresponding to entry in the clocks property.

  Optional properties:
    - power-domains : power-domain property defined with a phandle
  			   to respective power domain.
    - memory-region : from reserved memory binding: phandles to two reserved
  	memory regions, first is for "left" mfc memory bus interfaces,
  	second if for the "right" mfc memory bus, used when no SYSMMU
  	support is available; used only by MFC v5 present in Exynos4 SoCs

  Obsolete properties:
    - samsung,mfc-r, samsung,mfc-l : support removed, please use memory-region
  	property instead
