  Chips&Media Coda multi-standard codec IP
  ========================================

  Coda codec IPs are present in i.MX SoCs in various versions,
  called VPU (Video Processing Unit).

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "fsl,<chip>-src" for i.MX SoCs:
    (a) "fsl,imx27-vpu" for CodaDx6 present in i.MX27
    (b) "fsl,imx53-vpu" for CODA7541 present in i.MX53
    (c) "fsl,imx6q-vpu" for CODA960 present in i.MX6q
  - reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
    SoC reference manual
  - interrupts : Should contain the VPU interrupt. For CODA960,
    a second interrupt is needed for the MJPEG unit.
  - clocks : Should contain the ahb and per clocks, in the order
    determined by the clock-names property.
  - clock-names : Should be "ahb", "per"
  - iram : phandle pointing to the SRAM device node
