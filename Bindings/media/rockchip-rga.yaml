  RGA is a standalone 2D raster graphic acceleration unit. It accelerates 2D
  graphics operations, such as point/line drawing, image scaling, rotation,
  BitBLT, alpha blending and image blur/sharpness.

  device-tree bindings for rockchip 2D raster graphic acceleration controller (RGA)

  RGA is a standalone 2D raster graphic acceleration unit. It accelerates 2D
  graphics operations, such as point/line drawing, image scaling, rotation,
  BitBLT, alpha blending and image blur/sharpness.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be one of the following
  		"rockchip,rk3288-rga";
  		"rockchip,rk3399-rga";

  - interrupts: RGA interrupt specifier.

  - clocks: phandle to RGA sclk/hclk/aclk clocks

  - clock-names: should be "aclk", "hclk" and "sclk"

  - resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names: should be "core", "axi" and "ahb"
