title: Renesas R-Car Frame Compression Processor (FCP)

maintainers:
  - Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart+renesas@ideasonboard.com>
description: |+
  The FCP is a companion module of video processing modules in the Renesas R-Car
  Gen3 SoCs. It provides data compression and decompression, data caching, and
  conversion of AXI transactions in order to reduce the memory bandwidth.

  There are three types of FCP: FCP for Codec (FCPC), FCP for VSP (FCPV) and FCP
  for FDP (FCPF). Their configuration and behaviour depend on the module they
  are paired with. These DT bindings currently support the FCPV and FCPF.

   - compatible: Must be one or more of the following

     - "renesas,fcpv" for generic compatible 'FCP for VSP'
     - "renesas,fcpf" for generic compatible 'FCP for FDP'

   - reg: the register base and size for the device registers
   - clocks: Reference to the functional clock

   - reg: the register base and size for the device registers
   - clocks: Reference to the functional clock

  Optional properties:
   - power-domains : power-domain property defined with a power domain specifier
  		   to respective power domain.
