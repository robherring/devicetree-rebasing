  Video multiplexers allow to select between multiple input ports. Video received
  on the active input port is passed through to the output port. Muxes described
  by this binding are controlled by a multiplexer controller that is described by
  the bindings in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mux/mux-controller.txt

  Video Multiplexer
  =================

  Video multiplexers allow to select between multiple input ports. Video received
  on the active input port is passed through to the output port. Muxes described
  by this binding are controlled by a multiplexer controller that is described by
  the bindings in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mux/mux-controller.txt

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "video-mux"
  - mux-controls : mux controller node to use for operating the mux
  - #address-cells: should be <1>
  - #size-cells: should be <0>
  - port@*: at least three port nodes containing endpoints connecting to the
    source and sink devices according to of_graph bindings. The last port is
    the output port, all others are inputs.

  Optionally, #address-cells, #size-cells, and port nodes can be grouped under a
  ports node as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
