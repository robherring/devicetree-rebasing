  Maxim Integrated MAX2175 RF to Bits tuner
  -----------------------------------------

  The MAX2175 IC is an advanced analog/digital hybrid-radio receiver with
  RF to Bits® front-end designed for software-defined radio solutions.

  Required properties:
  --------------------
  - compatible: "maxim,max2175" for MAX2175 RF-to-bits tuner.
  - clocks: clock specifier.
  - port: child port node corresponding to the I2S output, in accordance with
  	the video interface bindings defined in
  	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The port
  	node must contain at least one endpoint.

  Optional properties:
  --------------------
  - maxim,master	      : phandle to the master tuner if it is a slave. This
  			is used to define two tuners in diversity mode
  			(1 master, 1 slave). By default each tuner is an
  			individual master.
  - maxim,refout-load   : load capacitance value (in picofarads) on reference
  			output drive level. The possible load values are:
  			 0 (default - refout disabled)
  			10
  			20
  			30
  			40
  			60
  			70
  - maxim,am-hiz-filter : empty property indicates the AM Hi-Z filter is used
  			in this hardware for AM antenna input.
