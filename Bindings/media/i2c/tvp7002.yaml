  * Texas Instruments TV7002 video decoder

  The TVP7002 device supports digitizing of video and graphics signal in RGB and
  YPbPr color space.

  Required Properties :
  - compatible : Must be "ti,tvp7002"

  Optional Properties:
  - hsync-active: HSYNC Polarity configuration for the bus. Default value when
    this property is not specified is <0>.

  - vsync-active: VSYNC Polarity configuration for the bus. Default value when
    this property is not specified is <0>.

  - pclk-sample: Clock polarity of the bus. Default value when this property is
    not specified is <0>.

  - sync-on-green-active: Active state of Sync-on-green signal property of the
    endpoint.
    0 = Normal Operation (Active Low, Default)
    1 = Inverted operation

  - field-even-active: Active-high Field ID output polarity control of the bus.
    Under normal operation, the field ID output is set to logic 1 for an odd field
    (field 1) and set to logic 0 for an even field (field 0).
    0 = Normal Operation (Active Low, Default)
    1 = FID output polarity inverted

  video-interfaces.txt.
