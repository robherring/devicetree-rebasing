  The Sony imx274 is a 1/2.5-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
  an active array size of 3864H x 2202V. It is programmable through I2C
  interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x1a as per sensor data sheet.
  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as 4 lanes
  at 1440 Mbps.

  * Sony 1/2.5-Inch 8.51Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

  The Sony imx274 is a 1/2.5-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
  an active array size of 3864H x 2202V. It is programmable through I2C
  interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x1a as per sensor data sheet.
  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as 4 lanes
  at 1440 Mbps.


  Required Properties:
  - compatible: value should be "sony,imx274" for imx274 sensor
  - reg: I2C bus address of the device

  Optional Properties:
  - reset-gpios: Sensor reset GPIO

  The imx274 device node should contain one 'port' child node with
  an 'endpoint' subnode. For further reading on port node refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
