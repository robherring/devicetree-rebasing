description: |+
  The TVP5150 and TVP5151 are video decoders that convert baseband NTSC and PAL
  (and also SECAM in the TVP5151 case) video signals to either 8-bit 4:2:2 YUV
  with discrete syncs or 8-bit ITU-R BT.656 with embedded syncs output formats.

  * Texas Instruments TVP5150 and TVP5151 video decoders

  The TVP5150 and TVP5151 are video decoders that convert baseband NTSC and PAL
  (and also SECAM in the TVP5151 case) video signals to either 8-bit 4:2:2 YUV
  with discrete syncs or 8-bit ITU-R BT.656 with embedded syncs output formats.

  Required Properties:
  - compatible: value must be "ti,tvp5150"
  - reg: I2C slave address

  Optional Properties:
  - pdn-gpios: phandle for the GPIO connected to the PDN pin, if any.
  - reset-gpios: phandle for the GPIO connected to the RESETB pin, if any.

  The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
  video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

  Required Endpoint Properties for parallel synchronization:

  - hsync-active: active state of the HSYNC signal. Must be <1> (HIGH).
  - vsync-active: active state of the VSYNC signal. Must be <1> (HIGH).
  - field-even-active: field signal level during the even field data
    transmission. Must be <0>.

  If none of hsync-active, vsync-active and field-even-active is specified,
  the endpoint is assumed to use embedded BT.656 synchronization.
