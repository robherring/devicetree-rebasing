description: |+
  The Silicon Labs Si4713 is an FM radio transmitter with receive power scan
  supporting 76-108 MHz. It includes an RDS encoder and has both, a stereo-analog
  and a digital interface, which supports I2S, left-justified and a custom
  DSP-mode format. It is programmable through an I2C interface.
