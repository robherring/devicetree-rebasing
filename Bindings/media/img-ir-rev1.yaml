  * ImgTec Infrared (IR) decoder version 1

  This binding is for Imagination Technologies' Infrared decoder block,
  specifically major revision 1.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Should be "img,ir-rev1"
  - reg:			Physical base address of the controller and length of
  			memory mapped region.
  - interrupts:		The interrupt specifier to the cpu.

  Optional properties:
  - clocks:		List of clock specifiers as described in standard
  			clock bindings.
  			Up to 3 clocks may be specified in the following order:
  			1st:	Core clock (defaults to 32.768KHz if omitted).
  			2nd:	System side (fast) clock.
  			3rd:	Power modulation clock.
  - clock-names:		List of clock names corresponding to the clocks
  			specified in the clocks property.
  			Accepted clock names are:
  			"core":	Core clock.
  			"sys":	System clock.
  			"mod":	Power modulation clock.
