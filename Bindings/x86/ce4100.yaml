  The CE4100 SoC uses for in core peripherals the following compatible
  format: <vendor>,<chip>-<device>.
  Many of the "generic" devices like HPET or IO APIC have the ce4100
  name in their compatible property because they first appeared in this
  SoC.

  The CPU node
  ------------
  	cpu@0 {
  		device_type = "cpu";
  		compatible = "intel,ce4100";
  		reg = <0>;
  		lapic = <&lapic0>;
  	};

  The reg property describes the CPU number. The lapic property points to
  the local APIC timer.

  The SoC node
  ------------

  This node describes the in-core peripherals. Required property:
    compatible = "intel,ce4100-cp";

  The PCI node
  ------------
  This node describes the PCI bus on the SoC. Its property should be
    compatible = "intel,ce4100-pci", "pci";

  If the OS is using the IO-APIC for interrupt routing then the reported
  interrupt numbers for devices is no longer true. In order to obtain the
  correct interrupt number, the child node which represents the device has
  to contain the interrupt property. Besides the interrupt property it has
  to contain at least the reg property containing the PCI bus address and
  compatible property according to "PCI Bus Binding Revision 2.1".
