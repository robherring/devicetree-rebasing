  Qualcomm SLIMbus controller
  This controller is used if applications processor driver controls SLIMbus
  master component.

  Required properties:

   - #address-cells - refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/slimbus/bus.txt
   - #size-cells	- refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/slimbus/bus.txt

   - reg : Offset and length of the register region(s) for the device
   - reg-names : Register region name(s) referenced in reg above
  	 Required register resource entries are:
  	 "ctrl": Physical address of controller register blocks
   	 "slew": required for "qcom,apq8064-slim" SOC.
   - compatible : should be "qcom,<SOC-NAME>-slim" for SOC specific compatible
   		followed by "qcom,slim" for fallback.
   - interrupts : Interrupt number used by this controller
   - clocks : Interface and core clocks used by this SLIMbus controller
   - clock-names : Required clock-name entries are:
  	"iface" : Interface clock for this controller
  	"core" : Interrupt for controller core's BAM
