  The ARC700 can be configured with a pipeline performance monitor for counting
  CPU and cache events like cache misses and hits. Like conventional PCT there
  are 100+ hardware conditions dynamically mapped to up to 32 counters

  Note that:
   * The ARC 700 PCT does not support interrupts; although HW events may be
     counted, the HW events themselves cannot serve as a trigger for a sample.
