  Device-Tree Bindings for a PPS Signal on GPIO

  These properties describe a PPS (pulse-per-second) signal connected to
  a GPIO pin.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "pps-gpio"
  - gpios: one PPS GPIO in the format described by ../gpio/gpio.txt

  Optional properties:
  - assert-falling-edge: when present, assert is indicated by a falling edge
                         (instead of by a rising edge)
