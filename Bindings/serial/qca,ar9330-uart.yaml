  * Qualcomm Atheros AR9330 High-Speed UART

  Required properties:

  - compatible: Must be "qca,ar9330-uart"

  - reg: Specifies the physical base address of the controller and
    the length of the memory mapped region.

  - interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller that
    services interrupts for this device.

  - interrupts: Specifies the interrupt source of the parent interrupt
    controller. The format of the interrupt specifier depends on the
    parent interrupt controller.

  Additional requirements:

    Each UART port must have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
    node.
