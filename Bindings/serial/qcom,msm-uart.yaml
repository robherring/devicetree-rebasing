  * MSM Serial UART

  The MSM serial UART hardware is designed for low-speed use cases where a
  dma-engine isn't needed. From a software perspective it's mostly compatible
  with the MSM serial UARTDM except that it only supports reading and writing one
  character at a time.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain "qcom,msm-uart"
  - reg: Should contain UART register location and length.
  - interrupts: Should contain UART interrupt.
  - clocks: Should contain the core clock.
  - clock-names: Should be "core".
