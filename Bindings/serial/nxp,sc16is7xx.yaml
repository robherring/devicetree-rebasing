  * NXP SC16IS7xx advanced Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)
  * i2c as bus

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of the following:
    - "nxp,sc16is740" for NXP SC16IS740,
    - "nxp,sc16is741" for NXP SC16IS741,
    - "nxp,sc16is750" for NXP SC16IS750,
    - "nxp,sc16is752" for NXP SC16IS752,
    - "nxp,sc16is760" for NXP SC16IS760,
    - "nxp,sc16is762" for NXP SC16IS762.
  - reg: I2C address of the SC16IS7xx device.
  - interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller that
    services interrupts for this IC.
  - interrupts: Should contain the UART interrupt
  - clocks: Reference to the IC source clock.

  Optional properties:
  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the GPIO number and
    the second cell is used to specify the GPIO polarity:
      0 = active high,
      1 = active low.
