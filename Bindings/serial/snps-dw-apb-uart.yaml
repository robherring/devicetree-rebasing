  * Synopsys DesignWare ABP UART

  Required properties:
  - compatible : "snps,dw-apb-uart"
  - reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
  - interrupts : should contain uart interrupt.

  Clock handling:
  The clock rate of the input clock needs to be supplied by one of
  - clock-frequency : the input clock frequency for the UART.
  - clocks : phandle to the input clock

  The supplying peripheral clock can also be handled, needing a second property
  - clock-names: tuple listing input clock names.
  	Required elements: "baudclk", "apb_pclk"

  Optional properties:
  - snps,uart-16550-compatible : reflects the value of UART_16550_COMPATIBLE
    configuration parameter. Define this if your UART does not implement the busy
    functionality.
  - resets : phandle to the parent reset controller.
  - reg-shift : quantity to shift the register offsets by.  If this property is
    not present then the register offsets are not shifted.
  - reg-io-width : the size (in bytes) of the IO accesses that should be
    performed on the device.  If this property is not present then single byte
    accesses are used.
  - dcd-override : Override the DCD modem status signal. This signal will always
    be reported as active instead of being obtained from the modem status
    register. Define this if your serial port does not use this pin.
  - dsr-override : Override the DTS modem status signal. This signal will always
    be reported as active instead of being obtained from the modem status
    register. Define this if your serial port does not use this pin.
  - cts-override : Override the CTS modem status signal. This signal will always
    be reported as active instead of being obtained from the modem status
    register. Define this if your serial port does not use this pin.
  - ri-override : Override the RI modem status signal. This signal will always be
    reported as inactive instead of being obtained from the modem status register.
    Define this if your serial port does not use this pin.
