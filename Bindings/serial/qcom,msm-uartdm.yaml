  The MSM serial UARTDM hardware is designed for high-speed use cases where the
  transmit and/or receive channels can be offloaded to a dma-engine. From a
  software perspective it's mostly compatible with the MSM serial UART except
  that it supports reading and writing multiple characters at a time.

  * MSM Serial UARTDM

  The MSM serial UARTDM hardware is designed for high-speed use cases where the
  transmit and/or receive channels can be offloaded to a dma-engine. From a
  software perspective it's mostly compatible with the MSM serial UART except
  that it supports reading and writing multiple characters at a time.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain at least "qcom,msm-uartdm".
                A more specific property should be specified as follows depending
  	      on the version:
  		"qcom,msm-uartdm-v1.1"
  		"qcom,msm-uartdm-v1.2"
  		"qcom,msm-uartdm-v1.3"
  		"qcom,msm-uartdm-v1.4"
  - reg: Should contain UART register locations and lengths. The first
         register shall specify the main control registers. An optional second
         register location shall specify the GSBI control region.
         "qcom,msm-uartdm-v1.3" is the only compatible value that might
         need the GSBI control region.
  - interrupts: Should contain UART interrupt.
  - clocks: Should contain the core clock and the AHB clock.
  - clock-names: Should be "core" for the core clock and "iface" for the
  	       AHB clock.

  Optional properties:
  - dmas: Should contain dma specifiers for transmit and receive channels
  - dma-names: Should contain "tx" for transmit and "rx" for receive channels
  - qcom,tx-crci: Identificator <u32> for Client Rate Control Interface to be
             used with TX DMA channel. Required when using DMA for transmission
             with UARTDM v1.3 and below.
  - qcom,rx-crci: Identificator <u32> for Client Rate Control Interface to be
             used with RX DMA channel. Required when using DMA for reception
             with UARTDM v1.3 and below.

  Note: Aliases may be defined to ensure the correct ordering of the UARTs.
  The alias serialN will result in the UART being assigned port N.  If any
  serialN alias exists, then an alias must exist for each enabled UART.  The
  serialN aliases should be in a .dts file instead of in a .dtsi file.
