description: |+
  Required properties for all SoCs:
  - compatible : Should be one of fallowing variants:
  	"fsl,imx23-auart" - Freescale i.MX23
  	"fsl,imx28-auart" - Freescale i.MX28
  	"alphascale,asm9260-auart" - Alphascale ASM9260
  - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupts : Should contain the auart interrupt numbers
  - dmas: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node
    and AUART DMA channel ID.
    Refer to dma.txt and fsl-mxs-dma.txt for details.
  - dma-names: "rx" for RX channel, "tx" for TX channel.

  Required properties for "alphascale,asm9260-auart":
  - clocks : the clocks feeding the watchdog timer. See clock-bindings.txt
  - clock-names : should be set to
  	"mod" - source for tick counter.
  	"ahb" - ahb gate.

  * Freescale MXS Application UART (AUART)

  Required properties for all SoCs:
  - compatible : Should be one of fallowing variants:
  	"fsl,imx23-auart" - Freescale i.MX23
  	"fsl,imx28-auart" - Freescale i.MX28
  	"alphascale,asm9260-auart" - Alphascale ASM9260
  - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupts : Should contain the auart interrupt numbers
  - dmas: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node
    and AUART DMA channel ID.
    Refer to dma.txt and fsl-mxs-dma.txt for details.
  - dma-names: "rx" for RX channel, "tx" for TX channel.

  Required properties for "alphascale,asm9260-auart":
  - clocks : the clocks feeding the watchdog timer. See clock-bindings.txt
  - clock-names : should be set to
  	"mod" - source for tick counter.
  	"ahb" - ahb gate.

  Optional properties:
  - uart-has-rtscts : Indicate the UART has RTS and CTS lines
    for hardware flow control,
  	it also means you enable the DMA support for this UART.
  - {rts,cts,dtr,dsr,rng,dcd}-gpios: specify a GPIO for RTS/CTS/DTR/DSR/RI/DCD
    line respectively. It will use specified PIO instead of the peripheral
    function pin for the USART feature.
    If unsure, don't specify this property.
