description: |+
  This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
  attached devices. Common examples include Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC and GPS
  devices.

  Serial attached devices shall be a child node of the host UART device the
  slave device is attached to. It is expected that the attached device is
  the only child node of the UART device. The slave device node name shall
  reflect the generic type of device for the node.

  Serial Slave Device DT binding

  This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
  attached devices. Common examples include Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC and GPS
  devices.

  Serial attached devices shall be a child node of the host UART device the
  slave device is attached to. It is expected that the attached device is
  the only child node of the UART device. The slave device node name shall
  reflect the generic type of device for the node.

  Required Properties:

  - compatible 	: A string reflecting the vendor and specific device the node
  		  represents.

  Optional Properties:

  - max-speed	: The maximum baud rate the device operates at. This should
  		  only be present if the maximum is less than the slave device
  		  can support. For example, a particular board has some signal
  		  quality issue or the host processor can't support higher
  		  baud rates.
  - current-speed	: The current baud rate the device operates at. This should
  		  only be present in case a driver has no chance to know
  		  the baud rate of the slave device.
  		  Examples:
  		    * device supports auto-baud
  		    * the rate is setup by a bootloader and there is no
  		      way to reset the device
  		    * device baud rate is configured by its firmware but
  		      there is no way to request the actual settings
