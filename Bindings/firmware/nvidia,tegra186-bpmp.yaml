  NVIDIA Tegra Boot and Power Management Processor (BPMP)

  The BPMP is a specific processor in Tegra chip, which is designed for
  booting process handling and offloading the power management, clock
  management, and reset control tasks from the CPU. The binding document
  defines the resources that would be used by the BPMP firmware driver,
  which can create the interprocessor communication (IPC) between the CPU
  and BPMP.

  Required properties:
  - name : Should be bpmp
  - compatible
      Array of strings
      One of:
      - "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp"
  - mboxes : The phandle of mailbox controller and the mailbox specifier.
  - shmem : List of the phandle of the TX and RX shared memory area that
  	  the IPC between CPU and BPMP is based on.
  - #clock-cells : Should be 1.
  - #power-domain-cells : Should be 1.
  - #reset-cells : Should be 1.

  This node is a mailbox consumer. See the following files for details of
  the mailbox subsystem, and the specifiers implemented by the relevant
  provider(s):

  - .../mailbox/mailbox.txt
  - .../mailbox/nvidia,tegra186-hsp.txt

  This node is a clock, power domain, and reset provider. See the following
  files for general documentation of those features, and the specifiers
  implemented by this node:

  - .../clock/clock-bindings.txt
  - <dt-bindings/clock/tegra186-clock.h>
  - ../power/power_domain.txt
  - <dt-bindings/power/tegra186-powergate.h>
  - .../reset/reset.txt
  - <dt-bindings/reset/tegra186-reset.h>

  The BPMP implements some services which must be represented by separate nodes.
  For example, it can provide access to certain I2C controllers, and the I2C
  bindings represent each I2C controller as a device tree node. Such nodes should
  be nested directly inside the main BPMP node.

  Software can determine whether a child node of the BPMP node represents a device
  by checking for a compatible property. Any node with a compatible property
  represents a device that can be instantiated. Nodes without a compatible
  property may be used to provide configuration information regarding the BPMP
  itself, although no such configuration nodes are currently defined by this
  binding.

  The BPMP firmware defines no single global name-/numbering-space for such
  services. Put another way, the numbering scheme for I2C buses is distinct from
  the numbering scheme for any other service the BPMP may provide (e.g. a future
  hypothetical SPI bus service). As such, child device nodes will have no reg
  property, and the BPMP node will have no #address-cells or #size-cells property.

  The shared memory bindings for BPMP
  -----------------------------------

  The shared memory area for the IPC TX and RX between CPU and BPMP are
  predefined and work on top of sysram, which is an SRAM inside the chip.

  See ".../sram/sram.txt" for the bindings.
