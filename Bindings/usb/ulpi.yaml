description: |
  Phys that are behind a ULPI connection can be described with the following
  binding. The host controller shall have a "ulpi" named node as a child, and
  that node shall have one enabled node underneath it representing the ulpi
  device on the bus.

  EXAMPLE
  -------

  usb {
  	compatible = "vendor,usb-controller";

  	ulpi {
  		phy {
  			compatible = "vendor,phy";
  		};
  	};
  };
