  USB NOP PHY

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be usb-nop-xceiv
  - #phy-cells: Must be 0

  Optional properties:
  - clocks: phandle to the PHY clock. Use as per Documentation/devicetree
    /bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
    This property is required if clock-frequency is specified.

  - clock-names: Should be "main_clk"

  - clock-frequency: the clock frequency (in Hz) that the PHY clock must
    be configured to.

  - vcc-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the PHY.

  - reset-gpios: Should specify the GPIO for reset.

  - vbus-detect-gpio: should specify the GPIO detecting a VBus insertion
                      (see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt)
  - vbus-regulator : should specifiy the regulator supplying current drawn from
    the VBus line (see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt).
