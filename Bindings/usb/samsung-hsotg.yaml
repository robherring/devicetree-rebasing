maintainers:
  - Tomasz Figa <t.figa@samsung.com>
description: |+
  The Samsung HSOTG IP can be found on Samsung SoCs, from S3C6400 onwards.
  It gives functionality of OTG-compliant USB 2.0 host and device with
  support for USB 2.0 high-speed (480Mbps) and full-speed (12 Mbps)
  operation.

  Currently only device mode is supported.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "samsung,s3c6400-hsotg" should be used for all currently
      supported SoC,
  - interrupt-parent: phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
      interrupt signal of the HSOTG block is routed,
  - interrupts: specifier of interrupt signal of interrupt controller,
      according to bindings of interrupt controller,
  - clocks: contains an array of clock specifiers:
      - first entry: OTG clock
  - clock-names: contains array of clock names:
      - first entry: must be "otg"
  - vusb_d-supply: phandle to voltage regulator of digital section,
  - vusb_a-supply: phandle to voltage regulator of analog section.
