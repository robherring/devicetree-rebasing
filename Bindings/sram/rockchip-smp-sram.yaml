title: 'Rockchip SRAM for smp bringup:'

maintainers:

description: |+
  Rockchip's smp-capable SoCs use the first part of the sram for the bringup
  of the cores. Once the core gets powered up it executes the code that is
  residing at the very beginning of the sram.

  Therefore a reserved section sub-node has to be added to the mmio-sram
  declaration.

             

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - const: rockchip,rk3066-smp-sram
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 1
    additionalItems: false
  reg:
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 1
    additionalItems: false
examples:

    sram: sram@10080000 {
      compatible = "mmio-sram";
      reg = <0x10080000 0x10000>;
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <1>;
      ranges;

      smp-sram@10080000 {
        compatible = "rockchip,rk3066-smp-sram";

  Rockchip SRAM for smp bringup:
  ------------------------------

  Rockchip's smp-capable SoCs use the first part of the sram for the bringup
  of the cores. Once the core gets powered up it executes the code that is
  residing at the very beginning of the sram.

  Therefore a reserved section sub-node has to be added to the mmio-sram
  declaration.

  Required sub-node properties:
  - compatible : should be "rockchip,rk3066-smp-sram"

  The rest of the properties should follow the generic mmio-sram discription
  found in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.txt
