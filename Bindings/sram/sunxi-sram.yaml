  Allwinnner SoC SRAM controllers
  -----------------------------------------------------

  The SRAM controller found on most Allwinner devices is represented by
  a regular node for the SRAM controller itself, with sub-nodes
  reprensenting the SRAM handled by the SRAM controller.

  Controller Node
  ---------------

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be:
      - "allwinner,sun4i-a10-sram-controller"
      - "allwinner,sun50i-a64-sram-controller"
  - reg : sram controller register offset + length

  SRAM nodes
  ----------

  Each SRAM is described using the mmio-sram bindings documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.txt

  Each SRAM will have SRAM sections that are going to be handled by the
  SRAM controller as subnodes. These sections are represented following
  once again the representation described in the mmio-sram binding.

  The valid sections compatible for A10 are:
      - allwinner,sun4i-a10-sram-a3-a4
      - allwinner,sun4i-a10-sram-d

  The valid sections compatible for A64 are:
      - allwinner,sun50i-a64-sram-c

  Devices using SRAM sections
  ---------------------------

  Some devices need to request to the SRAM controller to map an SRAM for
  their exclusive use.

  The relationship between such a device and an SRAM section is
  expressed through the allwinner,sram property, that will take a
  phandle and an argument.

  This valid values for this argument are:
    - 0: CPU
    - 1: Device
