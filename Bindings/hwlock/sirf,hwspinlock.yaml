title: SIRF Hardware spinlock device Binding

maintainers:

description: |
  Required properties :
  - compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
  	"sirf,hwspinlock"

  - reg : the register address of hwspinlock

  - #hwlock-cells : hwlock users only use the hwlock id to represent a specific
  	hwlock, so the number of cells should be <1> here.

  Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
  "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"

  Example of hwlock provider:
  	hwlock {
  		compatible = "sirf,hwspinlock";
  		reg = <0x13240000 0x00010000>;
  		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
  	};

  Example of hwlock users:
  	node {
  		...
  		hwlocks = <&hwlock 2>;
  		...
  	};
             

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - const: sirf,hwspinlock
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 1
    additionalItems: false
  reg:
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 1
    additionalItems: false
  num-spinlocks: {}
