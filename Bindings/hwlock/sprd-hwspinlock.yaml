description: |
  Required properties :
  - compatible : should be "sprd,hwspinlock-r3p0".
  - reg : the register address of hwspinlock.
  - #hwlock-cells : hwlock users only use the hwlock id to represent a specific
  	hwlock, so the number of cells should be <1> here.
  - clock-names : Must contain "enable".
  - clocks : Must contain a phandle entry for the clock in clock-names, see the
  	common clock bindings.

  Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
  "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"

  Example of hwlock provider:
  	hwspinlock@40500000 {
  		compatible  = "sprd,hwspinlock-r3p0";
  		reg = <0 0x40500000 0 0x1000>;
  		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
  		clock-names = "enable";
  		clocks = <&clk_aon_apb_gates0 22>;
  	};
             

properties:
  compatible: {}

    hwspinlock@40500000 {

      #hwlock-cells = <1>;
