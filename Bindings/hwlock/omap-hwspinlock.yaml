  OMAP4+ HwSpinlock Driver
  ========================

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Should be "ti,omap4-hwspinlock" for
  			    OMAP44xx, OMAP54xx, AM33xx, AM43xx, DRA7xx SoCs
  - reg:			Contains the hwspinlock module register address space
  			(base address and length)
  - ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated with the hwspinlock device
  - #hwlock-cells:	Should be 1. The OMAP hwspinlock users will use a
  			0-indexed relative hwlock number as the argument
  			specifier value for requesting a specific hwspinlock
  			within a hwspinlock bank.

  Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
  "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"
