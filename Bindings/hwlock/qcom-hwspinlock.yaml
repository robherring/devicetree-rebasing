title: 'Qualcomm Hardware Mutex Block:'

maintainers:

description: |
  The hardware block provides mutexes utilized between different processors on
  the SoC as part of the communication protocol used by these processors.

  - compatible:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <string>
  	Definition: must be one of:
  		    "qcom,sfpb-mutex",
  		    "qcom,tcsr-mutex"

  - syscon:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  	Definition: one cell containing:
  		    syscon phandle
  		    offset of the hwmutex block within the syscon
  		    stride of the hwmutex registers

  - #hwlock-cells:
  	Usage: required
  	Value type: <u32>
  	Definition: must be 1, the specified cell represent the lock id
  		    (hwlock standard property, see hwlock.txt)

  Example:

  	tcsr_mutex_block: syscon@fd484000 {
  		compatible = "syscon";
  		reg = <0xfd484000 0x2000>;
  	};

  	hwlock@fd484000 {
  		compatible = "qcom,tcsr-mutex";
  		syscon = <&tcsr_mutex_block 0 0x80>;

  		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
  	};
