  NAND support for Marvell Orion SoC platforms

  Required properties:
  - compatible : "marvell,orion-nand".
  - reg : Base physical address of the NAND and length of memory mapped
  	region

  Optional properties:
  - cle : Address line number connected to CLE. Default is 0
  - ale : Address line number connected to ALE. Default is 1
  - bank-width : Width in bytes of the device. Default is 1
  - chip-delay : Chip dependent delay for transferring data from array to read
                 registers in usecs

  The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
  address space. See partition.txt for more detail.
