  * Ingenic JZ4780 NAND/BCH

  This file documents the device tree bindings for NAND flash devices on the
  JZ4780. NAND devices are connected to the NEMC controller (described in
  memory-controllers/ingenic,jz4780-nemc.txt), and thus NAND device nodes must
  be children of the NEMC node.

  Required NAND controller device properties:
  - compatible: Should be set to "ingenic,jz4780-nand".
  - reg: For each bank with a NAND chip attached, should specify a bank number,
    an offset of 0 and a size of 0x1000000 (i.e. the whole NEMC bank).

  Optional NAND controller device properties:
  - ingenic,bch-controller: To make use of the hardware BCH controller, this
    property must contain a phandle for the BCH controller node. The required
    properties for this node are described below. If this is not specified,
    software BCH will be used instead.

  Optional children nodes:
  - Individual NAND chips are children of the NAND controller node.

  Required children node properties:
  - reg: An integer ranging from 1 to 6 representing the CS line to use.

  Optional children node properties:
  - nand-ecc-step-size: ECC block size in bytes.
  - nand-ecc-strength: ECC strength (max number of correctable bits).
  - nand-ecc-mode: String, operation mode of the NAND ecc mode. "hw" by default
  - nand-on-flash-bbt: boolean to enable on flash bbt option, if not present false
  - rb-gpios: GPIO specifier for the busy pin.
  - wp-gpios: GPIO specifier for the write protect pin.

  Optional child node of NAND chip nodes:
  - partitions: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/partition.txt
