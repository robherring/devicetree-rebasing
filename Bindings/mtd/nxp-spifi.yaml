description: |+
  NXP SPIFI is a specialized SPI interface for serial Flash devices.
  It supports one Flash device with 1-, 2- and 4-bits width in SPI
  mode 0 or 3. The controller operates in either command or memory
  mode. In memory mode the Flash is accessible from the CPU as
  normal memory.

  * NXP SPI Flash Interface (SPIFI)

  NXP SPIFI is a specialized SPI interface for serial Flash devices.
  It supports one Flash device with 1-, 2- and 4-bits width in SPI
  mode 0 or 3. The controller operates in either command or memory
  mode. In memory mode the Flash is accessible from the CPU as
  normal memory.

  Required properties:
    - compatible : Should be "nxp,lpc1773-spifi"
    - reg : the first contains the register location and length,
            the second contains the memory mapping address and length
    - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "spifi" and "flash"
    - interrupts : Should contain the interrupt for the device
    - clocks : The clocks needed by the SPIFI controller
    - clock-names : Should contain the clock names "spifi" and "reg"

  Optional properties:
   - resets : phandle + reset specifier

  The SPI Flash must be a child of the SPIFI node and must have a
  compatible property as specified in bindings/mtd/jedec,spi-nor.txt

  Optionally it can also contain the following properties.
   - spi-cpol : Controller only supports mode 0 and 3 so either
                both spi-cpol and spi-cpha should be present or
                none of them
   - spi-cpha : See above
   - spi-rx-bus-width : Used to select how many pins that are used
                        for input on the controller

  See bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt for more information.
