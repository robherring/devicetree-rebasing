description: |+
  The Firmware Memory Controller in the Aspeed AST2500 SoC supports
  three chip selects, two of which are always of SPI type and the third
  can be SPI or NOR type flash. These bindings only describe SPI.

  The two SPI flash memory controllers in the AST2500 each support two
  chip selects.

  * Aspeed Firmware Memory controller
  * Aspeed SPI Flash Memory Controller

  The Firmware Memory Controller in the Aspeed AST2500 SoC supports
  three chip selects, two of which are always of SPI type and the third
  can be SPI or NOR type flash. These bindings only describe SPI.

  The two SPI flash memory controllers in the AST2500 each support two
  chip selects.

  Required properties:
    - compatible : Should be one of
  	"aspeed,ast2400-fmc" for the AST2400 Firmware Memory Controller
  	"aspeed,ast2400-spi" for the AST2400 SPI Flash memory Controller
  	"aspeed,ast2500-fmc" for the AST2500 Firmware Memory Controller
  	"aspeed,ast2500-spi" for the AST2500 SPI flash memory controllers

    - reg : the first contains the control register location and length,
            the second contains the memory window mapping address and length
    - #address-cells : must be 1 corresponding to chip select child binding
    - #size-cells : must be 0 corresponding to chip select child binding

  Optional properties:
    - interrupts : Should contain the interrupt for the dma device if an
      FMC

  The child nodes are the SPI flash modules which must have a compatible
  property as specified in bindings/mtd/jedec,spi-nor.txt

  Optionally, the child node can contain properties for SPI mode (may be
  ignored):
    - spi-max-frequency - max frequency of spi bus
