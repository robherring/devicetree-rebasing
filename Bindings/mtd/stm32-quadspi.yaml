  * STMicroelectronics Quad Serial Peripheral Interface(QuadSPI)

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "st,stm32f469-qspi"
  - reg: the first contains the register location and length.
         the second contains the memory mapping address and length
  - reg-names: should contain the reg names "qspi" "qspi_mm"
  - interrupts: should contain the interrupt for the device
  - clocks: the phandle of the clock needed by the QSPI controller
  - A pinctrl must be defined to set pins in mode of operation for QSPI transfer

  Optional properties:
