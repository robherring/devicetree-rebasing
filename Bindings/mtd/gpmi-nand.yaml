  * Freescale General-Purpose Media Interface (GPMI)

  The GPMI nand controller provides an interface to control the
  NAND flash chips.

  Required properties:
    - compatible : should be "fsl,<chip>-gpmi-nand", chip can be:
      * imx23
      * imx28
      * imx6q
      * imx6sx
      * imx7d
    - reg : should contain registers location and length for gpmi and bch.
    - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "gpmi-nand" and "bch"
    - interrupts : BCH interrupt number.
    - interrupt-names : Should be "bch".
    - dmas: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node
      and GPMI DMA channel ID.
      Refer to dma.txt and fsl-mxs-dma.txt for details.
    - dma-names: Must be "rx-tx".
    - clocks : clocks phandle and clock specifier corresponding to each clock
      specified in clock-names.
    - clock-names : The "gpmi_io" clock is always required. Which clocks are
      exactly required depends on chip:
      * imx23/imx28 : "gpmi_io"
      * imx6q/sx : "gpmi_io", "gpmi_apb", "gpmi_bch", "gpmi_bch_apb", "per1_bch"
      * imx7d : "gpmi_io", "gpmi_bch_apb"

  Optional properties:
    - nand-on-flash-bbt: boolean to enable on flash bbt option if not
                         present false
    - fsl,use-minimum-ecc: Protect this NAND flash with the minimum ECC
                         strength required. The required ECC strength is
                         automatically discoverable for some flash
                         (e.g., according to the ONFI standard).
                         However, note that if this strength is not
                         discoverable or this property is not enabled,
                         the software may chooses an implementation-defined
                         ECC scheme.
    - fsl,no-blockmark-swap: Don't swap the bad block marker from the OOB
                         area with the byte in the data area but rely on the
                         flash based BBT for identifying bad blocks.
                         NOTE: this is only valid in conjunction with
                               'nand-on-flash-bbt'.
                         WARNING: on i.MX28 blockmark swapping cannot be
                         disabled for the BootROM in the FCB. Thus,
                         partitions written from Linux with this feature
                         turned on may not be accessible by the BootROM
                         code.

  The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
  address space. See partition.txt for more detail.
