  Device tree bindings for GPMC connected NANDs

  GPMC connected NAND (found on OMAP boards) are represented as child nodes of
  the GPMC controller with a name of "nand".

  All timing relevant properties as well as generic gpmc child properties are
  explained in a separate documents - please refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/omap-gpmc.txt

  For NAND specific properties such as ECC modes or bus width, please refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/nand.txt


  Required properties:

   - compatible:	"ti,omap2-nand"
   - reg:		range id (CS number), base offset and length of the
  		NAND I/O space
   - interrupt-parent: must point to gpmc node
   - interrupts:	Two interrupt specifiers, one for fifoevent, one for termcount.

  Optional properties:

   - nand-bus-width: 		Set this numeric value to 16 if the hardware
  				is wired that way. If not specified, a bus
  				width of 8 is assumed.

   - ti,nand-ecc-opt:		A string setting the ECC layout to use. One of:
  		"sw"		1-bit Hamming ecc code via software
  		"hw"		<deprecated> use "ham1" instead
  		"hw-romcode"	<deprecated> use "ham1" instead
  		"ham1"		1-bit Hamming ecc code
  		"bch4"		4-bit BCH ecc code
  		"bch8"		8-bit BCH ecc code
  		"bch16"		16-bit BCH ECC code
  		Refer below "How to select correct ECC scheme for your device ?"

   - ti,nand-xfer-type:		A string setting the data transfer type. One of:

  		"prefetch-polled"	Prefetch polled mode (default)
  		"polled"		Polled mode, without prefetch
  		"prefetch-dma"		Prefetch enabled DMA mode
  		"prefetch-irq"		Prefetch enabled irq mode

   - elm_id:	<deprecated> use "ti,elm-id" instead
   - ti,elm-id:	Specifies phandle of the ELM devicetree node.
  		ELM is an on-chip hardware engine on TI SoC which is used for
  		locating ECC errors for BCHx algorithms. SoC devices which have
  		ELM hardware engines should specify this device node in .dtsi
  		Using ELM for ECC error correction frees some CPU cycles.
   - rb-gpios:	GPIO specifier for the ready/busy# pin.

  For inline partition table parsing (optional):

   - #address-cells: should be set to 1
   - #size-cells: should be set to 1

...
