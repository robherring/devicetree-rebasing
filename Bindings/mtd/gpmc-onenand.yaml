  Device tree bindings for GPMC connected OneNANDs

  GPMC connected OneNAND (found on OMAP boards) are represented as child nodes of
  the GPMC controller with a name of "onenand".

  All timing relevant properties as well as generic gpmc child properties are
  explained in a separate documents - please refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/omap-gpmc.txt

  Required properties:

   - compatible:		"ti,omap2-onenand"
   - reg:			The CS line the peripheral is connected to
   - gpmc,device-width:	Width of the ONENAND device connected to the GPMC
  			in bytes. Must be 1 or 2.

  Optional properties:

   - int-gpios:		GPIO specifier for the INT pin.

  For inline partition table parsing (optional):

   - #address-cells: should be set to 1
   - #size-cells: should be set to 1

...
