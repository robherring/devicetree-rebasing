  Device tree bindings for Texas instruments Davinci/Keystone NAND controller

  This file provides information, what the device node for the davinci/keystone
  NAND interface contains.

  Documentation:
  Davinci DM646x - http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/sprueq7c/sprueq7c.pdf
  Kestone - http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/sprugz3a/sprugz3a.pdf

  Required properties:

  - compatible:			"ti,davinci-nand"
  				"ti,keystone-nand"

  - reg:				Contains 2 offset/length values:
  				- offset and length for the access window.
  				- offset and length for accessing the AEMIF
  				control registers.

  - ti,davinci-chipselect:	number of chipselect. Indicates on the
  				davinci_nand driver which chipselect is used
  				for accessing the nand.
  				Can be in the range [0-3].

  Recommended properties :

  - ti,davinci-mask-ale:		mask for ALE. Needed for executing address
  				phase. These offset will be added to the base
  				address for the chip select space the NAND Flash
  				device is connected to.
  				If not set equal to 0x08.

  - ti,davinci-mask-cle:		mask for CLE. Needed for executing command
  				phase. These offset will be added to the base
  				address for the chip select space the NAND Flash
  				device is connected to.
  				If not set equal to 0x10.

  - ti,davinci-mask-chipsel:	mask for chipselect address. Needed to mask
  				addresses for given chipselect.

  - nand-ecc-mode:		operation mode of the NAND ecc mode. ECC mode
  				valid values for davinci driver:
  				- "none"
  				- "soft"
  				- "hw"

  - ti,davinci-ecc-bits:		used ECC bits, currently supported 1 or 4.

  - nand-bus-width:		buswidth 8 or 16. If not present 8.

  - nand-on-flash-bbt:		use flash based bad block table support. OOB
  				identifier is saved in OOB area. If not present
  				false.

  Deprecated properties:

  - ti,davinci-ecc-mode:		operation mode of the NAND ecc mode. ECC mode
  				valid values for davinci driver:
  				- "none"
  				- "soft"
  				- "hw"

  - ti,davinci-nand-buswidth:	buswidth 8 or 16. If not present 8.

  - ti,davinci-nand-use-bbt:	use flash based bad block table support. OOB
  				identifier is saved in OOB area. If not present
  				false.

  Nand device bindings may contain additional sub-nodes describing partitions of
  the address space. See partition.txt for more detail. The NAND Flash timing
  values must be programmed in the chip selectâ€™s node of AEMIF
  memory-controller (see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/
  davinci-aemif.txt).
