  Required parameters:
  - compatible :		"st,pwm"
  - #pwm-cells : 		Number of cells used to specify a PWM. First cell
  			specifies the per-chip index of the PWM to use and the
  			second cell is the period in nanoseconds - fixed to 2
  			for STiH41x.
  - reg :			Physical base address and length of the controller's
  			registers.
  - pinctrl-names: 	Set to "default".
  - pinctrl-0: 		List of phandles pointing to pin configuration nodes
  			for PWM module.
  			For Pinctrl properties, please refer to [1].
  - clock-names: 		Valid entries are "pwm" and/or "capture".
  - clocks: 		phandle of the clock used by the PWM module.
  			For Clk properties, please refer to [2].
  - interrupts:		IRQ for the Capture device
