  Google's ChromeOS EC PWM is a simple PWM attached to the Embedded Controller
  (EC) and controlled via a host-command interface.

  An EC PWM node should be only found as a sub-node of the EC node (see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/cros-ec.txt).

  * PWM controlled by ChromeOS EC

  Google's ChromeOS EC PWM is a simple PWM attached to the Embedded Controller
  (EC) and controlled via a host-command interface.

  An EC PWM node should be only found as a sub-node of the EC node (see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/cros-ec.txt).

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Must contain "google,cros-ec-pwm"
  - #pwm-cells: Should be 1. The cell specifies the PWM index.
