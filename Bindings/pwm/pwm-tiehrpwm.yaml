  TI SOC EHRPWM based PWM controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Must be "ti,<soc>-ehrpwm".
    for am33xx  - compatible = "ti,am3352-ehrpwm", "ti,am33xx-ehrpwm";
    for am4372  - compatible = "ti,am4372-ehrpwm", "ti-am3352-ehrpwm", "ti,am33xx-ehrpwm";
    for da850   - compatible = "ti,da850-ehrpwm", "ti-am3352-ehrpwm", "ti,am33xx-ehrpwm";
    for dra746 - compatible = "ti,dra746-ehrpwm", "ti-am3352-ehrpwm";
  - #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format. The only third cell flag supported by this binding is
    PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED.
  - reg: physical base address and size of the registers map.

  Optional properties:
  - clocks: Handle to the PWM's time-base and functional clock.
  - clock-names: Must be set to "tbclk" and "fck".
