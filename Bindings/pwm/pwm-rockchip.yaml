  Rockchip PWM controller

  Required properties:
   - compatible: should be "rockchip,<name>-pwm"
     "rockchip,rk2928-pwm": found on RK29XX,RK3066 and RK3188 SoCs
     "rockchip,rk3288-pwm": found on RK3288 SOC
     "rockchip,rv1108-pwm", "rockchip,rk3288-pwm": found on RV1108 SoC
     "rockchip,vop-pwm": found integrated in VOP on RK3288 SoC
   - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
   - clocks: See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt
     - For older hardware (rk2928, rk3066, rk3188, rk3228, rk3288, rk3399):
       - There is one clock that's used both to derive the functional clock
         for the device and as the bus clock.
     - For newer hardware (rk3328 and future socs): specified by name
       - "pwm": This is used to derive the functional clock.
       - "pclk": This is the APB bus clock.
   - #pwm-cells: must be 2 (rk2928) or 3 (rk3288). See pwm.txt in this directory
     for a description of the cell format.
