  VIA/Wondermedia VT8500/WM8xxx series SoC PWM controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "via,vt8500-pwm"
  - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format. The only third cell flag supported by this binding is
    PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED.
  - clocks: phandle to the PWM source clock
