  TI SOC based PWM Subsystem

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Must be "ti,<soc>-pwmss".
    for am33xx  - compatible = "ti,am33xx-pwmss";
    for am4372  - compatible = "ti,am4372-pwmss","ti,am33xx-pwmss";
    for dra746 - compatible = "ti,dra746-pwmss", "ti,am33xx-pwmss"

  - reg: physical base address and size of the registers map.
  - address-cells: Specify the number of u32 entries needed in child nodes.
  		  Should set to 1.
  - size-cells: specify number of u32 entries needed to specify child nodes size
  		in reg property. Should set to 1.
  - ranges: describes the address mapping of a memory-mapped bus. Should set to
  	   physical address map of child's base address, physical address within
  	   parent's address  space and length of the address map. For am33xx,
  	   3 set of child register maps present, ECAP register space, EQEP
  	   register space, EHRPWM register space.

  Also child nodes should also populated under PWMSS DT node.
