  Hisilicon PWM controller

  Required properties:
  -compatible: should contain one SoC specific compatible string
   The SoC specific strings supported including:
  	"hisilicon,hi3516cv300-pwm"
  	"hisilicon,hi3519v100-pwm"
  - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
  - clocks: phandle and clock specifier of the PWM reference clock.
  - resets: phandle and reset specifier for the PWM controller reset.
  - #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format.
