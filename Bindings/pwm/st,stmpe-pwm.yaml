  == ST STMPE PWM controller ==

  This is a PWM block embedded in the ST Microelectronics STMPE
  (ST Multi-Purpose Expander) chips. The PWM is registered as a
  subdevices of the STMPE MFD device.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be:
    - "st,stmpe-pwm"
  - #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format.
