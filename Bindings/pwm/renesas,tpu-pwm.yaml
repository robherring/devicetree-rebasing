  * Renesas R-Car Timer Pulse Unit PWM Controller

  Required Properties:

    - compatible: should be one of the following.
      - "renesas,tpu-r8a73a4": for R8A77A4 (R-Mobile APE6) compatible PWM controller.
      - "renesas,tpu-r8a7740": for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) compatible PWM controller.
      - "renesas,tpu-r8a7790": for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) compatible PWM controller.
      - "renesas,tpu": for generic R-Car TPU PWM controller.

    - reg: Base address and length of each memory resource used by the PWM
      controller hardware module.

    - #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
      the cells format. The only third cell flag supported by this binding is
      PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED.

  Please refer to pwm.txt in this directory for details of the common PWM bindings
  used by client devices.
