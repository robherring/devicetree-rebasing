  Allwinner sun4i and sun7i SoC PWM controller

  Required properties:
    - compatible: should be one of:
      - "allwinner,sun4i-a10-pwm"
      - "allwinner,sun5i-a10s-pwm"
      - "allwinner,sun5i-a13-pwm"
      - "allwinner,sun7i-a20-pwm"
      - "allwinner,sun8i-h3-pwm"
    - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
    - #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
      the cells format.
    - clocks: From common clock binding, handle to the parent clock.
