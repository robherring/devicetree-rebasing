description: |
  This controller has 4 channels.

  Required Properties :
  - compatible: must be "brcm,iproc-pwm"
  - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - clocks: phandle + clock specifier pair for the external clock
  - #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a
    description of the cells format.

  Refer to clocks/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer properties.

  Example:

  pwm: pwm@18031000 {
  	compatible = "brcm,iproc-pwm";
  	reg = <0x18031000 0x28>;
  	clocks = <&osc>;
  	#pwm-cells = <3>;
  };
