  JZ4740 and similar SoCs real-time clock driver

  Required properties:

  - compatible: One of:
    - "ingenic,jz4740-rtc" - for use with the JZ4740 SoC
    - "ingenic,jz4780-rtc" - for use with the JZ4780 SoC
  - reg: Address range of rtc register set
  - interrupts: IRQ number for the alarm interrupt
  - clocks: phandle to the "rtc" clock
  - clock-names: must be "rtc"

  Optional properties:
  - system-power-controller: To use this component as the
    system power controller
  - reset-pin-assert-time-ms: Reset pin low-level assertion
    time after wakeup (default 60ms; range 0-125ms if RTC clock
    at 32 kHz)
  - min-wakeup-pin-assert-time-ms: Minimum wakeup pin assertion
    time (default 100ms; range 0-2s if RTC clock at 32 kHz)
