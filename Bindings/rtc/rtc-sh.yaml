  * Real Time Clock for Renesas SH and ARM SoCs

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "renesas,r7s72100-rtc" and "renesas,sh-rtc" as a
    fallback.
  - reg: physical base address and length of memory mapped region.
  - interrupts: 3 interrupts for alarm, period, and carry.
  - interrupt-names: The interrupts should be labeled as "alarm", "period", and
    "carry".
  - clocks: The functional clock source for the RTC controller must be listed
    first (if exists). Additionally, potential clock counting sources are to be
    listed.
  - clock-names: The functional clock must be labeled as "fck". Other clocks
    may be named in accordance to the SoC hardware manuals.
