  NVIDIA Tegra20 real-time clock

  The Tegra RTC maintains seconds and milliseconds counters, and five alarm
  registers. The alarms and other interrupts may wake the system from low-power
  state.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : For Tegra20, must contain "nvidia,tegra20-rtc".  Otherwise,
    must contain '"nvidia,<chip>-rtc", "nvidia,tegra20-rtc"', where <chip>
    can be tegra30, tegra114, tegra124, or tegra132.
  - reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
  - interrupts : A single interrupt specifier.
  - clocks : Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
