  * Faraday Technology FTRTC010 Real Time Clock

  This RTC appears in for example the Storlink Gemini family of
  SoCs.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be one of:
    "faraday,ftrtc010"
    "cortina,gemini-rtc", "faraday,ftrtc010"

  Optional properties:
  - clocks: when present should contain clock references to the
    PCLK and EXTCLK clocks. Faraday calls the later CLK1HZ and
    says the clock should be 1 Hz, but implementers actually seem
    to choose different clocks here, like Cortina who chose
    32768 Hz (a typical low-power clock).
  - clock-names: should name the clocks "PCLK" and "EXTCLK"
    respectively.
