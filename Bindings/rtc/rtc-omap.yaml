  TI Real Time Clock

  Required properties:
  - compatible:
  	- "ti,da830-rtc"  - for RTC IP used similar to that on DA8xx SoC family.
  	- "ti,am3352-rtc" - for RTC IP used similar to that on AM335x SoC family.
  			    This RTC IP has special WAKE-EN Register to enable
  			    Wakeup generation for event Alarm. It can also be
  			    used to control an external PMIC via the
  			    pmic_power_en pin.
  	- "ti,am4372-rtc" - for RTC IP used similar to that on AM437X SoC family.
  - reg: Address range of rtc register set
  - interrupts: rtc timer, alarm interrupts in order
  - interrupt-parent: phandle for the interrupt controller

  Optional properties:
  - system-power-controller: whether the rtc is controlling the system power
    through pmic_power_en
  - clocks: Any internal or external clocks feeding in to rtc
  - clock-names: Corresponding names of the clocks
  - pinctrl-0: a phandle pointing to the pin settings for the device
  - pinctrl-names: should be "default"

  Optional subnodes:
  - generic pinctrl node

  Required pinctrl subnodes properties:
  - pins - Names of ext_wakeup pins to configure

  Optional pinctrl subnodes properties:
  - input-enable - Enables ext_wakeup
  - ti,active-high - Set input active high (by default active low)
