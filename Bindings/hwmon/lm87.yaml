  *LM87 hwmon sensor.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be
  	"ti,lm87"

  - reg: I2C address

  optional properties:
  - has-temp3: This configures pins 18 and 19 to be used as a second
               remote temperature sensing channel. By default the pins
               are configured as voltage input pins in0 and in5.

  - has-in6: When set, pin 5 is configured to be used as voltage input
             in6. Otherwise the pin is set as FAN1 input.

  - has-in7: When set, pin 6 is configured to be used as voltage input
             in7. Otherwise the pin is set as FAN2 input.

  - vcc-supply: a Phandle for the regulator supplying power, can be
                cofigured to measure 5.0V power supply. Default is 3.3V.
