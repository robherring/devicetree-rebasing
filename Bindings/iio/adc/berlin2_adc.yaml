  * Berlin Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

  The Berlin ADC has 8 channels, with one connected to a temperature sensor.
  It is part of the system controller register set. The ADC node should be a
  sub-node of the system controller node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "marvell,berlin2-adc"
  - interrupts: the interrupts for the ADC and the temperature sensor
  - interrupt-names: should be "adc" and "tsen"
