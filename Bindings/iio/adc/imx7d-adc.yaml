  Freescale imx7d ADC bindings

  The devicetree bindings are for the ADC driver written for
  imx7d SoC.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "fsl,imx7d-adc"
  - reg: Offset and length of the register set for the ADC device
  - interrupts: The interrupt number for the ADC device
  - clocks: The root clock of the ADC controller
  - clock-names: Must contain "adc", matching entry in the clocks property
  - vref-supply: The regulator supply ADC reference voltage
