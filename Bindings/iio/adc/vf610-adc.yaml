  Freescale vf610 Analog to Digital Converter bindings

  The devicetree bindings are for the new ADC driver written for
  vf610/i.MX6slx and upward SoCs from Freescale.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain "fsl,vf610-adc"
  - reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupts: Should contain the interrupt for the device
  - clocks: The clock is needed by the ADC controller, ADC clock source is ipg clock.
  - clock-names: Must contain "adc", matching entry in the clocks property.
  - vref-supply: The regulator supply ADC reference voltage.

  Recommended properties:
  - fsl,adck-max-frequency: Maximum frequencies according to datasheets operating
    requirements. Three values are required, depending on conversion mode:
    - Frequency in normal mode (ADLPC=0, ADHSC=0)
    - Frequency in high-speed mode (ADLPC=0, ADHSC=1)
    - Frequency in low-power mode (ADLPC=1, ADHSC=0)
  - min-sample-time: Minimum sampling time in nanoseconds. This value has
    to be chosen according to the conversion mode and the connected analog
    source resistance (R_as) and capacitance (C_as). Refer the datasheet's
    operating requirements. A safe default across a wide range of R_as and
    C_as as well as conversion modes is 1000ns.
