  Aspeed ADC

  This device is a 10-bit converter for 16 voltage channels.  All inputs are
  single ended.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "aspeed,ast2400-adc" or "aspeed,ast2500-adc"
  - reg: memory window mapping address and length
  - clocks: Input clock used to derive the sample clock. Expected to be the
            SoC's APB clock.
  - resets: Reset controller phandle
  - #io-channel-cells: Must be set to <1> to indicate channels are selected
                       by index.
