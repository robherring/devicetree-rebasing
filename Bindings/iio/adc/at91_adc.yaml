  * AT91's Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

  Required properties:
    - compatible: Should be "atmel,<chip>-adc"
      <chip> can be "at91sam9260", "at91sam9g45" or "at91sam9x5"
    - reg: Should contain ADC registers location and length
    - interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the ADC
    - clock-names: tuple listing input clock names.
  	Required elements: "adc_clk", "adc_op_clk".
    - clocks: phandles to input clocks.
    - atmel,adc-channels-used: Bitmask of the channels muxed and enabled for this
      device
    - atmel,adc-startup-time: Startup Time of the ADC in microseconds as
      defined in the datasheet
    - atmel,adc-vref: Reference voltage in millivolts for the conversions
    - atmel,adc-res: List of resolutions in bits supported by the ADC. List size
  		   must be two at least.
    - atmel,adc-res-names: Contains one identifier string for each resolution
  			 in atmel,adc-res property. "lowres" and "highres"
  			 identifiers are required.

  Optional properties:
    - atmel,adc-use-external-triggers: Boolean to enable the external triggers
    - atmel,adc-use-res: String corresponding to an identifier from
  		       atmel,adc-res-names property. If not specified, the highest
  		       resolution will be used.
    - atmel,adc-sleep-mode: Boolean to enable sleep mode when no conversion
    - atmel,adc-sample-hold-time: Sample and Hold Time in microseconds
    - atmel,adc-ts-wires: Number of touchscreen wires. Should be 4 or 5. If this
                          value is set, then the adc driver will enable touchscreen
                          support.
      NOTE: when adc touchscreen is enabled, the adc hardware trigger will be
            disabled. Since touchscreen will occupy the trigger register.
    - atmel,adc-ts-pressure-threshold: a pressure threshold for touchscreen. It
                                       makes touch detection more precise.

  Optional trigger Nodes:
    - Required properties:
      * trigger-name: Name of the trigger exposed to the user
      * trigger-value: Value to put in the Trigger register
        to activate this trigger
    - Optional properties:
      * trigger-external: Is the trigger an external trigger?
