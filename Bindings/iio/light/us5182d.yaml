  * UPISEMI us5182d I2C ALS and Proximity sensor

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "upisemi,usd5182"
  - reg: the I2C address of the device

  Optional properties:
  - upisemi,glass-coef: glass attenuation factor - compensation factor of
                        resolution 1000 for material transmittance.

  - upisemi,dark-ths: array of 8 elements containing 16-bit thresholds (adc
                      counts) corresponding to every scale.

  - upisemi,upper-dark-gain: 8-bit dark gain compensation factor(4 int and 4
                             fractional bits - Q4.4) applied when light > threshold

  - upisemi,lower-dark-gain: 8-bit dark gain compensation factor(4 int and 4
                             fractional bits - Q4.4) applied when light < threshold

  - upisemi,continuous: This chip has two power modes: one-shot (chip takes one
                        measurement and then shuts itself down) and continuous (
                        chip takes continuous measurements). The one-shot mode is
                        more power-friendly but the continuous mode may be more
                        reliable. If this property is specified the continuous
                        mode will be used instead of the default one-shot one for
                        raw reads.

  If the optional properties are not specified these factors will default to the
  values in the below example.
  The glass-coef defaults to no compensation for the covering material.
  The threshold array defaults to experimental values that work with US5182D
  sensor on evaluation board - roughly between 12-32 lux.
  There will be no dark-gain compensation by default when ALS > thresh
  (0 * dark-gain), and a 1.35 compensation factor when ALS < thresh.
