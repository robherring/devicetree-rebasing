description: |+
  The driver supports interrupt-driven and interrupt-less operation, depending
  on whether an interrupt property has been populated into the DT. Note that
  the optional generation of IIO events on rising/falling light threshold changes
  requires the use of interrupts. Without interrupts, only the simple reading
  of the current light value is supported through the IIO API.

  Required properties:
    - compatible: should be "ti,opt3001"
    - reg: the I2C address of the sensor

  Optional properties:
    - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
    - interrupts: interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ (configure for falling edge)
