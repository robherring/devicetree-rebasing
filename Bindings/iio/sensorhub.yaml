  Samsung Sensorhub driver

  Sensorhub is a MCU which manages several sensors and also plays the role
  of a virtual sensor device.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "samsung,sensorhub-rinato" or "samsung,sensorhub-thermostat"
  - spi-max-frequency: max SPI clock frequency
  - interrupt-parent: interrupt parent
  - interrupts: communication interrupt
  - ap-mcu-gpios: [out] ap to sensorhub line - used during communication
  - mcu-ap-gpios: [in] sensorhub to ap - used during communication
  - mcu-reset-gpios: [out] sensorhub reset
