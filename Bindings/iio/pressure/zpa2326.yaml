  Murata ZPA2326 pressure sensor

  Pressure sensor from Murata with SPI and I2C bus interfaces.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: "murata,zpa2326"
  - reg: the I2C address or SPI chip select the device will respond to

  Recommended properties for SPI bus usage:
  - spi-max-frequency: maximum SPI bus frequency as documented in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

  Optional properties:
  - vref-supply: an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VREF
    power to the sensor
  - vdd-supply: an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VDD
    power to the sensor
  - interrupt-parent: phandle to the parent interrupt controller as documented in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
  - interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ as documented in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
