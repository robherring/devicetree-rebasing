  * Devantech SRF04 ultrasonic range finder
    Bit-banging driver using two GPIOs

  Required properties:
   - compatible:	Should be "devantech,srf04"

   - trig-gpios:	Definition of the GPIO for the triggering (output)
  		This GPIO is set for about 10 us by the driver to tell the
  		device it should initiate the measurement cycle.

   - echo-gpios:	Definition of the GPIO for the echo (input)
  		This GPIO is set by the device as soon as an ultrasonic
  		burst is sent out and reset when the first echo is
  		received.
  		Thus this GPIO is set while the ultrasonic waves are doing
  		one round trip.
  		It needs to be an GPIO which is able to deliver an
  		interrupt because the time between two interrupts is
  		measured in the driver.
  		See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt for
  		information on how to specify a consumer gpio.
