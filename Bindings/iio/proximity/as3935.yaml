  Austrian Microsystems AS3935 Franklin lightning sensor device driver

  Required properties:
  	- compatible: must be "ams,as3935"
  	- reg: SPI chip select number for the device
  	- spi-max-frequency: specifies maximum SPI clock frequency
  	- spi-cpha: SPI Mode 1. Refer to spi/spi-bus.txt for generic SPI
  	slave node bindings.
  	- interrupt-parent : should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  	- interrupts : the sole interrupt generated by the device

  	Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
  	interrupt client node bindings.

  Optional properties:
  	- ams,tuning-capacitor-pf: Calibration tuning capacitor stepping
  	  value 0 - 120pF. This will require using the calibration data from
  	  the manufacturer.
  	- ams,nflwdth: Set the noise and watchdog threshold register on
  	  startup. This will need to set according to the noise from the
  	  MCU board, and possibly the local environment. Refer to the
  	  datasheet for the threshold settings.
