  * ST_LSM6DSx driver for STM 6-axis (acc + gyro) imu Mems sensors

  Required properties:
  - compatible: must be one of:
    "st,lsm6ds3"
    "st,lsm6ds3h"
    "st,lsm6dsl"
    "st,lsm6dsm"
  - reg: i2c address of the sensor / spi cs line

  Optional properties:
  - st,drdy-int-pin: the pin on the package that will be used to signal
    "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2).
  - drive-open-drain: the interrupt/data ready line will be configured
    as open drain, which is useful if several sensors share the same
    interrupt line. This is a boolean property.
    (This binding is taken from pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt)
    If the requested interrupt is configured as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH or
    IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING a pull-down resistor is needed to drive the line
    when it is not active, whereas a pull-up one is needed when interrupt
    line is configured as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.
  - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  - interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
    flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING, IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or
    IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.

    Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
    client node bindings.
