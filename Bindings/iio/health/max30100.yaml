  Maxim MAX30100 heart rate and pulse oximeter sensor

  * https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX30100.pdf

  Required properties:
    - compatible: must be "maxim,max30100"
    - reg: the I2C address of the sensor
    - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
    - interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

    Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
    interrupt client node bindings.

  Optional properties:
    - maxim,led-current-microamp: configuration for LED current in microamperes
      while the engine is running. First indexed value is the configuration for
      the RED LED, and second value is for the IR LED.

      Refer to the datasheet for the allowed current values.
