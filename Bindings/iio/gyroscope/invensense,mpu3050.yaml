  Invensense MPU-3050 Gyroscope device tree bindings

  Required properties:
    - compatible : should be "invensense,mpu3050"
    - reg : the I2C address of the sensor

  Optional properties:
    - interrupt-parent : should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
    - interrupts : interrupt mapping for the trigger interrupt from the
      internal oscillator. The following IRQ modes are supported:
      IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING, IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH and
      IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW. The driver should detect and configure the hardware
      for the desired interrupt type.
    - vdd-supply : supply regulator for the main power voltage.
    - vlogic-supply : supply regulator for the signal voltage.
    - mount-matrix : see iio/mount-matrix.txt

  Optional subnodes:
    - The MPU-3050 will pass through and forward the I2C signals from the
      incoming I2C bus, alternatively drive traffic to a slave device (usually
      an accelerometer) on its own initiative. Therefore is supports a subnode
      i2c gate node. For details see: i2c/i2c-gate.txt
