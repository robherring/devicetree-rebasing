  * STMicroelectronics sdhci-st MMC/SD controller

  This file documents the differences between the core properties in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt and the properties
  used by the sdhci-st driver.

  Required properties:
  - compatible:		Must be "st,sdhci" and it can be compatible to "st,sdhci-stih407"
  			to set the internal glue logic used for configuring the MMC
  			subsystem (mmcss) inside the FlashSS (available in STiH407 SoC
  			family).

  - clock-names:		Should be "mmc" and "icn".  (NB: The latter is not compulsory)
  			See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
  - clocks:		Phandle to the clock.
  			See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

  - interrupts:		One mmc interrupt should be described here.
  - interrupt-names:	Should be "mmcirq".

  - pinctrl-names:	A pinctrl state names "default" must be defined.
  - pinctrl-0:		Phandle referencing pin configuration of the sd/emmc controller.
  			See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-binding.txt

  - reg:			This must provide the host controller base address and it can also
  			contain the FlashSS Top register for TX/RX delay used by the driver
  			to configure DLL inside the flashSS, if so reg-names must also be
  			specified.

  Optional properties:
  - reg-names:		Should be "mmc" and "top-mmc-delay". "top-mmc-delay" is optional
  			for eMMC on stih407 family silicon to configure DLL inside FlashSS.

  - non-removable:	Non-removable slot. Also used for configuring mmcss in STiH407 SoC
  			family.
  			See:  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt.

  - bus-width:		Number of data lines.
  			See:  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt.

  - max-frequency:	Can be 200MHz, 100MHz or 50MHz (default) and used for
  			configuring the CCONFIG3 in the mmcss.
  			See:  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt.

  - resets:		Phandle and reset specifier pair to softreset line of HC IP.
  			See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt

  - vqmmc-supply:		Phandle to the regulator dt node, mentioned as the vcc/vdd
  			supply in eMMC/SD specs.

  - sd-uhs-sdr50:	To enable the SDR50 in the mmcss.
  			See:  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt.

  - sd-uhs-sdr104:	To enable the SDR104 in the mmcss.
  			See:  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt.

  - sd-uhs-ddr50:		To enable the DDR50 in the mmcss.
  			See:  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt.
