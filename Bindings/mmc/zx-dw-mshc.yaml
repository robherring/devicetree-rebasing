  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the ZTE specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

  * ZTE specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage
    Host Controller

  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the ZTE specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

  Required Properties:

  * compatible: should be
  	- "zte,zx296718-dw-mshc": for ZX SoCs
