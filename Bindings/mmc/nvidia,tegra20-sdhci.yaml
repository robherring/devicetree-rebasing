  * NVIDIA Tegra Secure Digital Host Controller

  This controller on Tegra family SoCs provides an interface for MMC, SD,
  and SDIO types of memory cards.

  This file documents differences between the core properties described
  by mmc.txt and the properties used by the sdhci-tegra driver.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : should be one of:
    - "nvidia,tegra20-sdhci": for Tegra20
    - "nvidia,tegra30-sdhci": for Tegra30
    - "nvidia,tegra114-sdhci": for Tegra114
    - "nvidia,tegra124-sdhci": for Tegra124 and Tegra132
    - "nvidia,tegra210-sdhci": for Tegra210
    - "nvidia,tegra186-sdhci": for Tegra186
  - clocks : Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
    See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
  - reset-names : Must include the following entries:
    - sdhci

  Optional properties:
  - power-gpios : Specify GPIOs for power control
