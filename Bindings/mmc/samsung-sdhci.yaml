  * Samsung's SDHCI Controller device tree bindings

  Samsung's SDHCI controller is used as a connectivity interface with external
  MMC, SD and eMMC storage mediums. This file documents differences between the
  core mmc properties described by mmc.txt and the properties used by the
  Samsung implementation of the SDHCI controller.

  Required SoC Specific Properties:
  - compatible: should be one of the following
    - "samsung,s3c6410-sdhci": For controllers compatible with s3c6410 sdhci
      controller.
    - "samsung,exynos4210-sdhci": For controllers compatible with Exynos4 sdhci
      controller.

  Required Board Specific Properties:
  - pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
  - pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".
