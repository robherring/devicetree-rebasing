  MMC/SD/SDIO slot directly connected to a SPI bus

  This file documents differences between the core properties described
  by mmc.txt and the properties used by the mmc_spi driver.

  Required properties:
  - spi-max-frequency : maximum frequency for this device (Hz).
  - voltage-ranges : two cells are required, first cell specifies minimum
    slot voltage (mV), second cell specifies maximum slot voltage (mV).
    Several ranges could be specified.

  Optional properties:
  - gpios : may specify GPIOs in this order: Card-Detect GPIO,
    Write-Protect GPIO. Note that this does not follow the
    binding from mmc.txt, for historical reasons.
  - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
    services interrupts for this device.
