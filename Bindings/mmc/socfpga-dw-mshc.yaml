  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Altera SOCFPGA specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.
