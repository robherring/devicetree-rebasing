  * ARM PrimeCell MultiMedia Card Interface (MMCI) PL180/1

  The ARM PrimeCell MMCI PL180 and PL181 provides an interface for
  reading and writing to MultiMedia and SD cards alike.

  This file documents differences between the core properties described
  by mmc.txt and the properties used by the mmci driver. Using "st" as
  the prefix for a property, indicates support by the ST Micro variant.

  Required properties:
  - compatible             : contains "arm,pl18x", "arm,primecell".
  - vmmc-supply            : phandle to the regulator device tree node, mentioned
                             as the VCC/VDD supply in the eMMC/SD specs.

  Optional properties:
  - arm,primecell-periphid : contains the PrimeCell Peripheral ID, it overrides
                             the ID provided by the HW
  - vqmmc-supply           : phandle to the regulator device tree node, mentioned
                             as the VCCQ/VDD_IO supply in the eMMC/SD specs.
  - st,sig-dir-dat0        : bus signal direction pin used for DAT[0].
  - st,sig-dir-dat2        : bus signal direction pin used for DAT[2].
  - st,sig-dir-dat31       : bus signal direction pin used for DAT[3] and DAT[1].
  - st,sig-dir-dat74       : bus signal direction pin used for DAT[4] to DAT[7].
  - st,sig-dir-cmd         : cmd signal direction pin used for CMD.
  - st,sig-pin-fbclk       : feedback clock signal pin used.

  Deprecated properties:
  - mmc-cap-mmc-highspeed  : indicates whether MMC is high speed capable.
  - mmc-cap-sd-highspeed   : indicates whether SD is high speed capable.
