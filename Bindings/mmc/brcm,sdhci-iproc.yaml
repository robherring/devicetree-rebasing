  	       "brcm,bcm2835-sdhci"
  	       "brcm,sdhci-iproc-cygnus"
  	       "brcm,sdhci-iproc"

  Use brcm2835-sdhci for Rasperry PI.

  Use sdhci-iproc-cygnus for Broadcom SDHCI Controllers
  restricted to 32bit host accesses to SDHCI registers.

  Use sdhci-iproc for Broadcom SDHCI Controllers that allow standard
  8, 16, 32-bit host access to SDHCI register.

  - clocks : The clock feeding the SDHCI controller.

  Optional properties:
    - sdhci,auto-cmd12: specifies that controller should use auto CMD12.
