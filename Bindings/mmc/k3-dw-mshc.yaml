  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

  * Hisilicon specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
    Storage Host Controller

  Read synopsys-dw-mshc.txt for more details

  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

  Required Properties:

  * compatible: should be one of the following.
    - "hisilicon,hi3660-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi3660 specific extensions.
    - "hisilicon,hi4511-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi4511 specific extensions.
    - "hisilicon,hi6220-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi6220 specific extensions.

  Optional Properties:
  - hisilicon,peripheral-syscon: phandle of syscon used to control peripheral.
