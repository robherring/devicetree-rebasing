  The Freescale MXS Synchronous Serial Ports (SSP) can act as a MMC controller

  This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
  and the properties used by the mxsmmc driver.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "fsl,<chip>-mmc".  The supported chips include
    imx23 and imx28.
  - interrupts: Should contain ERROR interrupt number
  - dmas: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node
    and SSP DMA channel ID.
    Refer to dma.txt and fsl-mxs-dma.txt for details.
