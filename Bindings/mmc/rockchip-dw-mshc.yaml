  * Rockchip specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
    Storage Host Controller

  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Rockchip specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

  Required Properties:

  * compatible: should be
  	- "rockchip,rk2928-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK2928 and following,
  							before RK3288
  	- "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3288
  	- "rockchip,rv1108-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RV1108
  	- "rockchip,rk3036-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3036
  	- "rockchip,rk3228-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK322x
  	- "rockchip,rk3328-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3328
  	- "rockchip,rk3368-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3368
  	- "rockchip,rk3399-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3399

  Optional Properties:
  * clocks: from common clock binding: if ciu_drive and ciu_sample are
    specified in clock-names, should contain handles to these clocks.

  * clock-names: Apart from the clock-names described in synopsys-dw-mshc.txt
    two more clocks "ciu-drive" and "ciu-sample" are supported. They are used
    to control the clock phases, "ciu-sample" is required for tuning high-
    speed modes.

  * rockchip,default-sample-phase: The default phase to set ciu_sample at
    probing, low speeds or in case where all phases work at tuning time.
    If not specified 0 deg will be used.

  * rockchip,desired-num-phases: The desired number of times that the host
    execute tuning when needed. If not specified, the host will do tuning
    for 360 times, namely tuning for each degree.
