title: TI MMC host controller for OMAP1 and 2420

description: |+
  The MMC Host Controller on TI OMAP1 and 2420 family provides
  an interface for MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

  This file documents differences between the core properties described
  by mmc.txt and the properties used by the omap mmc driver.

  Note that this driver will not work with omap2430 or later omaps,
  please see the omap hsmmc driver for the current omaps.

    Required properties:
