  * Atmel High Speed MultiMedia Card Interface

  This controller on atmel products provides an interface for MMC, SD and SDIO
  types of memory cards.

  This file documents differences between the core properties described
  by mmc.txt and the properties used by the atmel-mci driver.

  1) MCI node

  Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "atmel,hsmci"
  - #address-cells: should be one. The cell is the slot id.
  - #size-cells: should be zero.
  - at least one slot node
  - clock-names: tuple listing input clock names.
  	Required elements: "mci_clk"
  - clocks: phandles to input clocks.

  The node contains child nodes for each slot that the platform uses
