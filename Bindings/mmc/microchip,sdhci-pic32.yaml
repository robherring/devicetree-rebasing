  * Microchip PIC32 SDHCI Controller

  This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
  and the properties used by the sdhci-pic32 driver.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "microchip,pic32mzda-sdhci"
  - interrupts: Should contain interrupt
  - clock-names: Should be "base_clk", "sys_clk".
                 See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
  - clocks: Phandle to the clock.
            See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
  - pinctrl-names: A pinctrl state names "default" must be defined.
  - pinctrl-0: Phandle referencing pin configuration of the SDHCI controller.
               See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-binding.txt
