  The purpose of the simple MMC power sequence provider is to supports a set of
  common properties between various SOC designs. It thus enables us to use the
  same provider for several SOC designs.

  * The simple MMC power sequence provider

  The purpose of the simple MMC power sequence provider is to supports a set of
  common properties between various SOC designs. It thus enables us to use the
  same provider for several SOC designs.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : contains "mmc-pwrseq-simple".

  Optional properties:
  - reset-gpios : contains a list of GPIO specifiers. The reset GPIOs are asserted
  	at initialization and prior we start the power up procedure of the card.
  	They will be de-asserted right after the power has been provided to the
  	card.
  - clocks : Must contain an entry for the entry in clock-names.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - clock-names : Must include the following entry:
    "ext_clock" (External clock provided to the card).
  - post-power-on-delay-ms : Delay in ms after powering the card and
  	de-asserting the reset-gpios (if any)
  - power-off-delay-us : Delay in us after asserting the reset-gpios (if any)
  	during power off of the card.
