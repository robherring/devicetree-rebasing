  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Imagination specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

    Host Controller

  The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
  a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
  differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
  by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Imagination specific
  extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

  Required Properties:

  * compatible: should be
  	- "img,pistachio-dw-mshc": for Pistachio SoCs
