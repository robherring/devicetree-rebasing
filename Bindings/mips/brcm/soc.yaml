  * Broadcom cable/DSL/settop platforms

  Required properties:

  - compatible: "brcm,bcm3368", "brcm,bcm3384", "brcm,bcm33843"
                "brcm,bcm3384-viper", "brcm,bcm33843-viper"
                "brcm,bcm6328", "brcm,bcm6358", "brcm,bcm6362", "brcm,bcm6368",
                "brcm,bcm63168", "brcm,bcm63268",
                "brcm,bcm7125", "brcm,bcm7346", "brcm,bcm7358", "brcm,bcm7360",
                "brcm,bcm7362", "brcm,bcm7420", "brcm,bcm7425"

  The experimental -viper variants are for running Linux on the 3384's
  BMIPS4355 cable modem CPU instead of the BMIPS5000 application processor.

  Power management
  ----------------

  For power management (particularly, S2/S3/S5 system suspend), the following SoC
  components are needed:

  = Always-On control block (AON CTRL)

  This hardware provides control registers for the "always-on" (even in low-power
  modes) hardware, such as the Power Management State Machine (PMSM).

  Required properties:
  - compatible     : should be one of
  		   "brcm,bcm7425-aon-ctrl"
  		   "brcm,bcm7429-aon-ctrl"
  		   "brcm,bcm7435-aon-ctrl" and
  		   "brcm,brcmstb-aon-ctrl"
  - reg            : the register start and length for the AON CTRL block
