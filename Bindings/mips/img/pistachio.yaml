  Imagination Pistachio SoC
  =========================

  Required properties:
  --------------------
   - compatible: Must include "img,pistachio".

  CPU nodes:
  ----------
  A "cpus" node is required.  Required properties:
   - #address-cells: Must be 1.
   - #size-cells: Must be 0.
  A CPU sub-node is also required for at least CPU 0.  Since the topology may
  be probed via CPS, it is not necessary to specify secondary CPUs.  Required
  propertis:
   - device_type: Must be "cpu".
   - compatible: Must be "mti,interaptiv".
   - reg: CPU number.
   - clocks: Must include the CPU clock.  See ../../clock/clock-bindings.txt for
     details on clock bindings.
