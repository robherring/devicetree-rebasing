  Device Tree bindings for MVEBU SDRAM controllers

  The Marvell EBU SoCs all have a SDRAM controller. The SDRAM controller
  differs from one SoC variant to another, but they also share a number
  of commonalities.

  For now, this Device Tree binding documentation only documents the
  Armada XP SDRAM controller.

  Required properties:

   - compatible: for Armada XP, "marvell,armada-xp-sdram-controller"
   - reg: a resource specifier for the register space, which should
     include all SDRAM controller registers as per the datasheet.
