  * Ingenic JZ4780 NAND/external memory controller (NEMC)

  This file documents the device tree bindings for the NEMC external memory
  controller in Ingenic JZ4780

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be set to one of:
      "ingenic,jz4780-nemc" (JZ4780)
  - reg: Should specify the NEMC controller registers location and length.
  - clocks: Clock for the NEMC controller.
  - #address-cells: Must be set to 2.
  - #size-cells: Must be set to 1.
  - ranges: A set of ranges for each bank describing the physical memory layout.
    Each should specify the following 4 integer values:

      <cs number> 0 <physical address of mapping> <size of mapping>

  Each child of the NEMC node describes a device connected to the NEMC.

  Required child node properties:
  - reg: Should contain at least one register specifier, given in the following
    format:

      <cs number> <offset> <size>

    Multiple registers can be specified across multiple banks. This is needed,
    for example, for packaged NAND devices with multiple dies. Such devices
    should be grouped into a single node.

  Optional child node properties:
  - ingenic,nemc-bus-width: Specifies the bus width in bits. Defaults to 8 bits.
  - ingenic,nemc-tAS: Address setup time in nanoseconds.
  - ingenic,nemc-tAH: Address hold time in nanoseconds.
  - ingenic,nemc-tBP: Burst pitch time in nanoseconds.
  - ingenic,nemc-tAW: Access wait time in nanoseconds.
  - ingenic,nemc-tSTRV: Static memory recovery time in nanoseconds.

  If a child node references multiple banks in its "reg" property, the same value
  for all optional parameters will be configured for all banks. If any optional
  parameters are omitted, they will be left unchanged from whatever they are
  configured to when the NEMC device is probed (which may be the reset value as
  given in the hardware reference manual, or a value configured by the boot
  loader).
