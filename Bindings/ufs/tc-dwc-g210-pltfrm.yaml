  * Universal Flash Storage (UFS) DesignWare Host Controller

  DWC_UFS nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers and MPHY.
  Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.

  Required properties:
  - compatible	: compatible list must contain the PHY type & version:
  			"snps,g210-tc-6.00-20bit"
  			"snps,g210-tc-6.00-40bit"
  		  complemented with the Controller IP version:
  			"snps,dwc-ufshcd-1.40a"
  		  complemented with the JEDEC version:
  			"jedec,ufs-1.1"
  			"jedec,ufs-2.0"

  - reg		: <registers mapping>
  - interrupts	: <interrupt mapping for UFS host controller IRQ>
