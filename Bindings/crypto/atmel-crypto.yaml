  * Atmel HW cryptographic accelerators

  These are the HW cryptographic accelerators found on some Atmel products.

  * Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-aes".
  - reg: Should contain AES registers location and length.
  - interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the AES.
  - dmas: List of two DMA specifiers as described in
          atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
  - dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
               in the dmas property.
