  * Device Tree Bindings for IBM Virtual Trusted Platform Module(vtpm)

  Required properties:

  - compatible            : property name that conveys the platform architecture
                            identifiers, as 'IBM,vtpm'
  - device_type           : specifies type of virtual device
  - interrupts            : property specifying the interrupt source number and
                            sense code associated with this virtual I/O Adapters
  - ibm,my-drc-index      : integer index for the connector between the device
                            and its parent - present only if Dynamic
                            Reconfiguration(DR) Connector is enabled
  - ibm,#dma-address-cells: specifies the number of cells that are used to
                            encode the physical address field of dma-window
                            properties
  - ibm,#dma-size-cells   : specifies the number of cells that are used to
                            encode the size field of dma-window properties
  - ibm,my-dma-window     : specifies DMA window associated with this virtual
                            IOA
  - ibm,loc-code          : specifies the unique and persistent location code
                            associated with this virtual I/O Adapters
  - linux,sml-base        : 64-bit base address of the reserved memory allocated
                            for the firmware event log
  - linux,sml-size        : size of the memory allocated for the firmware event log
