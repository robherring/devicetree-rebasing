  * Device Tree Bindings for I2C based Trusted Platform Module(TPM)

  Required properties:

  - compatible     : 'manufacturer,model', eg. nuvoton,npct650
  - label          : human readable string describing the device, eg. "tpm"
  - linux,sml-base : 64-bit base address of the reserved memory allocated for
                     the firmware event log
  - linux,sml-size : size of the memory allocated for the firmware event log

  Optional properties:

  - powered-while-suspended: present when the TPM is left powered on between
                             suspend and resume (makes the suspend/resume
                             callbacks do nothing).
