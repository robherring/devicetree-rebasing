  ARM Mali Utgard GPU
  ===================

  Required properties:
    - compatible
      * Must be one of the following:
        + "arm,mali-300"
        + "arm,mali-400"
        + "arm,mali-450"
      * And, optionally, one of the vendor specific compatible:
        + allwinner,sun4i-a10-mali
        + allwinner,sun7i-a20-mali
        + allwinner,sun50i-h5-mali
        + amlogic,meson-gxbb-mali
        + amlogic,meson-gxl-mali
        + rockchip,rk3036-mali
        + rockchip,rk3066-mali
        + rockchip,rk3188-mali
        + rockchip,rk3228-mali
        + rockchip,rk3328-mali
        + stericsson,db8500-mali

    - reg: Physical base address and length of the GPU registers

    - interrupts: an entry for each entry in interrupt-names.
      See ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for details.

    - interrupt-names:
      * ppX: Pixel Processor X interrupt (X from 0 to 7)
      * ppmmuX: Pixel Processor X MMU interrupt (X from 0 to 7)
      * pp: Pixel Processor broadcast interrupt (mali-450 only)
      * gp: Geometry Processor interrupt
      * gpmmu: Geometry Processor MMU interrupt

    - clocks: an entry for each entry in clock-names
    - clock-names:
      * bus: bus clock for the GPU
      * core: clock driving the GPU itself

  Optional properties:
    - interrupt-names and interrupts:
      * pmu: Power Management Unit interrupt, if implemented in hardware

    - memory-region:
      Memory region to allocate from, as defined in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindi/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt

    - mali-supply:
      Phandle to regulator for the Mali device, as defined in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.

    - operating-points-v2:
      Operating Points for the GPU, as defined in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt

    - power-domains:
      A power domain consumer specifier as defined in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt

  Vendor-specific bindings
  ------------------------

  The Mali GPU is integrated very differently from one SoC to
  another. In order to accomodate those differences, you have the option
  to specify one more vendor-specific compatible, among:

    - allwinner,sun4i-a10-mali
      Required properties:
        * resets: phandle to the reset line for the GPU

    - allwinner,sun7i-a20-mali
      Required properties:
        * resets: phandle to the reset line for the GPU

    - allwinner,sun50i-h5-mali
      Required properties:
        * resets: phandle to the reset line for the GPU

    - Rockchip variants:
      Required properties:
        * resets: phandle to the reset line for the GPU

    - stericsson,db8500-mali
      Required properties:
        * interrupt-names and interrupts:
          + combined: combined interrupt of all of the above lines
