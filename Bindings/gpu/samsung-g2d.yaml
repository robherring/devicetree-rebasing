  * Samsung 2D Graphics Accelerator

  Required properties:
    - compatible : value should be one among the following:
  	(a) "samsung,s5pv210-g2d" for G2D IP present in S5PV210 & Exynos4210 SoC
  	(b) "samsung,exynos4212-g2d" for G2D IP present in Exynos4x12 SoCs
  	(c) "samsung,exynos5250-g2d" for G2D IP present in Exynos5250 SoC

    - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
  	  mapped region.

    - interrupts : G2D interrupt number to the CPU.
    - clocks : from common clock binding: handle to G2D clocks.
    - clock-names : names of clocks listed in clocks property, in the same
  		  order, depending on SoC type:
  		  - for S5PV210 and Exynos4 based SoCs: "fimg2d" and
  		    "sclk_fimg2d"
  		  - for Exynos5250 SoC: "fimg2d".
