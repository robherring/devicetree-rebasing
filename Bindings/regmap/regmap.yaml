  Devicetree binding for regmap

  Optional properties:

     little-endian,
     big-endian,
     native-endian:	See common-properties.txt for a definition

  Note:
  Regmap defaults to little-endian register access on MMIO based
  devices, this is by far the most common setting. On CPU
  architectures that typically run big-endian operating systems
  (e.g. PowerPC), registers can be defined as big-endian and must
  be marked that way in the devicetree.

  On SoCs that can be operated in both big-endian and little-endian
  modes, with a single hardware switch controlling both the endianness
  of the CPU and a byteswap for MMIO registers (e.g. many Broadcom MIPS
  chips), "native-endian" is used to allow using the same device tree
  blob in both cases.
