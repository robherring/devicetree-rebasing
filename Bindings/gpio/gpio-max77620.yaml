  GPIO driver for MAX77620 Power management IC from Maxim Semiconductor.

  Device has 8 GPIO pins which can be configured as GPIO as well as the
  special IO functions.

  Required properties:
  -------------------
  - gpio-controller : 	Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
  - #gpio-cells : 	Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
  			the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
  				0 = active high
  				1 = active low
  For more details, please refer generic GPIO DT binding document
  <devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt>.
