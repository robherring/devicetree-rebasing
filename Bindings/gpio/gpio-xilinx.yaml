  Dual channel GPIO controller with configurable number of pins
  (from 1 to 32 per channel). Every pin can be configured as
  input/output/tristate. Both channels share the same global IRQ but
  local interrupts can be enabled on channel basis.

  Xilinx plb/axi GPIO controller

  Dual channel GPIO controller with configurable number of pins
  (from 1 to 32 per channel). Every pin can be configured as
  input/output/tristate. Both channels share the same global IRQ but
  local interrupts can be enabled on channel basis.

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "xlnx,xps-gpio-1.00.a"
  - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
  - #gpio-cells : Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
    second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).
  - gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.

  Optional properties:
  - interrupts : Interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ.
  - interrupt-parent : Phandle for the interrupt controller that
    services interrupts for this device.
  - xlnx,all-inputs : if n-th bit is setup, GPIO-n is input
  - xlnx,dout-default : if n-th bit is 1, GPIO-n default value is 1
  - xlnx,gpio-width : gpio width
  - xlnx,tri-default : if n-th bit is 1, GPIO-n is in tristate mode
  - xlnx,is-dual : if 1, controller also uses the second channel
  - xlnx,all-inputs-2 : as above but for the second channel
  - xlnx,dout-default-2 : as above but the second channel
  - xlnx,gpio2-width : as above but for the second channel
  - xlnx,tri-default-2 : as above but for the second channel
