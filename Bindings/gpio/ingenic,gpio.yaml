  Ingenic jz47xx GPIO controller

  That the Ingenic GPIO driver node must be a sub-node of the Ingenic pinctrl
  driver node.

  Required properties:
  --------------------

   - compatible: Must contain one of:
      - "ingenic,jz4740-gpio"
      - "ingenic,jz4770-gpio"
      - "ingenic,jz4780-gpio"
   - reg: The GPIO bank number.
   - interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
   - interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
   - #interrupt-cells: Should be 2. Refer to
     ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for more details.
   - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
   - #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the second
      cell specifies GPIO flags, as defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>. Only the
      GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flags are supported.
   - gpio-ranges: Range of pins managed by the GPIO controller. Refer to
     'gpio.txt' in this directory for more details.
