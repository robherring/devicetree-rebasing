  This driver follows the usual pinctrl bindings found in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

  This driver employs the per-pin muxing pattern.

  AXP209 GPIO & pinctrl controller

  This driver follows the usual GPIO bindings found in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt

  This driver follows the usual pinctrl bindings found in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

  This driver employs the per-pin muxing pattern.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of:
  	- "x-powers,axp209-gpio"
  	- "x-powers,axp813-gpio"
  - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
    second is the GPIO flags.
  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.

  This node must be a subnode of the axp20x PMIC, documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/axp20x.txt
