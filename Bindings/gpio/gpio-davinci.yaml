  Davinci/Keystone GPIO controller bindings

  Required Properties:
  - compatible: should be "ti,dm6441-gpio": for Davinci da850 SoCs
  			"ti,keystone-gpio": for Keystone 2 66AK2H/K, 66AK2L,
  						66AK2E SoCs
  			"ti,k2g-gpio", "ti,keystone-gpio": for 66AK2G

  - reg: Physical base address of the controller and the size of memory mapped
         registers.

  - gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller.

  - #gpio-cells : Should be two.
    - first cell is the pin number
    - second cell is used to specify optional parameters (unused)

  - interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller.

  - interrupts: Array of GPIO interrupt number. Only banked or unbanked IRQs are
  	      supported at a time.

  - ti,ngpio: The number of GPIO pins supported.

  - ti,davinci-gpio-unbanked: The number of GPIOs that have an individual interrupt
  		            line to processor.

  - clocks: Should contain the device's input clock, and should be defined as per
            the appropriate clock bindings consumer usage in,

            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/keystone-gate.txt
                              for 66AK2HK/66AK2L/66AK2E SoCs or,

            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/ti,sci-clk.txt
                              for 66AK2G SoCs

  - clock-names: Name should be "gpio";

  Currently clock-names and clocks are needed for all keystone 2 platforms
  Davinci platforms do not have DT clocks as of now.

  The GPIO controller also acts as an interrupt controller. It uses the default
  two cells specifier as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
  interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
