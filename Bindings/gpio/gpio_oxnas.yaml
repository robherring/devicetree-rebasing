  * Oxford Semiconductor OXNAS SoC GPIO Controller

  Please refer to gpio.txt for generic information regarding GPIO bindings.

  Required properties:
   - compatible: "oxsemi,ox810se-gpio" or "oxsemi,ox820-gpio"
   - reg: Base address and length for the device.
   - interrupts: The port interrupt shared by all pins.
   - gpio-controller: Marks the port as GPIO controller.
   - #gpio-cells: Two. The first cell is the pin number and
     the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity as defined in
     defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>:
        0 = GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH
        1 = GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW
   - interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
   - #interrupt-cells: Two. The first cell is the GPIO number and second cell
     is used to specify the trigger type as defined in
     <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>:
        IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
        IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING
        IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH
   - gpio-ranges: Interaction with the PINCTRL subsystem, it also specifies the
     gpio base and count, should be in the format of numeric-gpio-range as
     specified in the gpio.txt file.
