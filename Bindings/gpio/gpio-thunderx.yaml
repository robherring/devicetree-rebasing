  Cavium ThunderX/OCTEON-TX GPIO controller bindings

  Required Properties:
  - reg: The controller bus address.
  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells: Must be 2.
    - First cell is the GPIO pin number relative to the controller.
    - Second cell is a standard generic flag bitfield as described in gpio.txt.

  Optional Properties:
  - compatible: "cavium,thunder-8890-gpio", unused as PCI driver binding is used.
  - interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
  - #interrupt-cells: Must be present and have value of 2 if
                      "interrupt-controller" is present.
    - First cell is the GPIO pin number relative to the controller.
    - Second cell is triggering flags as defined in interrupts.txt.
