description: |+
  This bindings describes the GPIO controller for Technologic's FPGA core.
  TS-4900's FPGA encodes the GPIO state on 3 bits, whereas the TS-7970's FPGA
  uses 2 bits: it doesn't use a dedicated input bit.

  * Technologic Systems I2C-FPGA's GPIO controller bindings

  This bindings describes the GPIO controller for Technologic's FPGA core.
  TS-4900's FPGA encodes the GPIO state on 3 bits, whereas the TS-7970's FPGA
  uses 2 bits: it doesn't use a dedicated input bit.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of the following
  		"technologic,ts4900-gpio"
  		"technologic,ts7970-gpio"
  - reg: Physical base address of the controller and length
         of memory mapped region.
  - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number.
  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.

  Optional property:
  - ngpios: Number of GPIOs this controller is instantiated with,
    the default is 32. See gpio.txt for more details.
