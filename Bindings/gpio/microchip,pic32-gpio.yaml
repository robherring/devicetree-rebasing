  * Microchip PIC32 GPIO devices (PIO).

  Required properties:
   - compatible: "microchip,pic32mzda-gpio"
   - reg: Base address and length for the device.
   - interrupts: The port interrupt shared by all pins.
   - gpio-controller: Marks the port as GPIO controller.
   - #gpio-cells: Two. The first cell is the pin number and
     the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity as defined in
     defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>:
        0 = GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH
        1 = GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW
        2 = GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN
   - interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
   - #interrupt-cells: Two. The first cell is the GPIO number and second cell
     is used to specify the trigger type as defined in
     <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>:
        IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
        IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING
        IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH
   - clocks: Clock specifier (see clock bindings for details).
   - microchip,gpio-bank: Specifies which bank a controller owns.
   - gpio-ranges: Interaction with the PINCTRL subsystem.
