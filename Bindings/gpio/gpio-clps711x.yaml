  Cirrus Logic CLPS711X GPIO controller

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "cirrus,ep7209-gpio"
  - reg: Physical base GPIO controller registers location and length.
    There should be two registers, first is DATA register, the second
    is DIRECTION.
  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
  - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and
    the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
      0 = active high
      1 = active low

  Note: Each GPIO port should have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
  node.
