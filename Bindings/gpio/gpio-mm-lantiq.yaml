  By attaching hardware latches to the EBU it is possible to create output

  written to outputs 16 bit to the latches.

  The node describing the memory mapped GPIOs needs to be a child of the node
  describing the "lantiq,localbus".

  Lantiq SoC External Bus memory mapped GPIO controller

  By attaching hardware latches to the EBU it is possible to create output
  only gpios. This driver configures a special memory address, which when
  written to outputs 16 bit to the latches.

  The node describing the memory mapped GPIOs needs to be a child of the node
  describing the "lantiq,localbus".

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "lantiq,gpio-mm-lantiq"
  - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
  - #gpio-cells : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
    the second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently
    unused).
  - gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller.

  Optional properties:
  - lantiq,shadow : The default value that we shall assume as already set on the
    shift register cascade.
